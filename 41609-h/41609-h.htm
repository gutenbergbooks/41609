<p class="smcap" style="font-weight:bold;text-indent:3em;">Gentlemen,</p>

<p>When you did me the honour to appoint me President
of your most useful Society as the successor of
the Marquess Camden, I felt anxious to express my sense
of that honour by some appropriate acknowledgment.</p>

<p>I at first thought of printing a MS. from my own
library, but, not finding one that seemed exactly suitable,
in my difficulty I applied to my old and valued friend
Mr. Bruce, and he pointed out to me Manningham's
Diary in the British Museum as possessing a varied
interest in the literary world which was likely to commend
it to your notice. I willingly adopted his suggestion;
and I owe to him my sincere acknowledgments
for the pains he has bestowed in seeing the work through
the press, and in prefacing it with an interesting essay.</p>

<p>I have now to offer you this copy of Manningham's
little book, and to assure you how sincerely I am</p>

<p style="text-indent:6em;">Your obedient and obliged servant,</p>
<p style="font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;text-align:right;display:block;">WILLIAM TITE.</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr style="width: 10%;margin-top:0em;margin-bottom:1.5em;">


<p>The original of <span class="smcap">Manningham's Diary</span>, which is here printed,
is No. 5353 in the Harleian collection of MSS. in the British
Museum. It is a diminutive 12mo. volume, measuring not quite
six inches by four, and containing 133 leaves. The handwriting,
of which an admirable representation is given in the fac-simile prefixed,
is small, and in the main extremely legible; yet in some few
places, from haste in the writer, from corrections, from blotting, from
the effects of time, and from other obvious causes, difficulties have
occurred in a word or two, which, even with the assistance of gentlemen
most skilful in reading the old hands, have not been entirely
overcome. The few instances in which the collater has been baffled
are indicated by marks of doubt.</p>

<p>The first historical writer who noticed this little volume for a
literary purpose was Mr. John Payne Collier. In his Annals of the
Stage, published in 1831 (i. 320), Mr. Collier quoted from this Diary
various passages connected with his special subject, and drew attention
to the principal personal facts disclosed by the writer respecting
himself, namely, that he had many relations in Kent, and had probably
been a member of the Middle Temple.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Joseph Hunter was the next writer who used the
work for an historical purpose.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> With his well-known fondness for
genealogical inquiries he applied himself to determine who the
writer was whom Mr. Collier had designated merely as a barrister.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span>
In this inquiry Mr. Hunter was completely successful. Pursuing the
clue given by the mention of relationships in Kent in the various
ways which would occur to a person skilled in such investigations,
Mr. Hunter fell upon a track in which coincidences between the
facts stated in the MS. and those elicited by his own researches
followed one another so rapidly as in the end to leave not even the
shadow of a doubt that the desired result had been obtained.</p>

<p>We shall briefly indicate the course by which Mr. Hunter arrived
at his conclusions. It looks easy enough after the end has been
attained, but it will be borne in mind that inquiries of this kind are
extremely discursive. The statement of a few leading facts upon
the establishment of which the final conclusion is arrived at, gives
no idea of the time lost in investigations which are merely tentative.
In all such inquiries we are soon reminded of the pretty passages
which, after turnings and windings almost <i>ad libitum</i>, are ultimately
found to lead to nothing.</p>

<p>Besides cousins of at least seven different names who are alluded
to by the Diarist, several of them in connection with Canterbury,
Sandwich, and Godmersham, there is one whom he specially commemorates
as "my cousin in Kent" (<a href="#Page_19">p. 19</a>), and whom he frequently
vouches by that designation, or merely as his cousin, as his authority
for information which he chronicles. This cousin was evidently the
writer's most important connection&mdash;the great man of the family.
To visit him and his somewhat wayward second wife was the principal
object of the Diarist's journeys into Kent. It also appears that
this cousin was a man advanced in life,&mdash;roughly stated to be 62
years of age in March 1602-3, and that he resided at a place called
Bradbourne, in the neighbourhood of Maidstone. This last fact led
directly to the identification desired.</p>

<p>Bradbourne was easily found. It has been for centuries a family
seat in the parish of East Malling. Hasted has represented the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span>
house in one of his pictorial illustrations pretty much as it yet exists.
It has been shorn indeed of many of the noble trees, of the deer,
and of some of the other aristocratic adornments with which the
county historian surrounded it, but it still stands a stately old-fashioned
red-brick mansion, probably of the date of the reign of
Queen Anne. Long before that period the same spot was occupied
by a previous residence of a county family. From the time of the
Protectorate it has belonged to a branch of the old Kentish stock,
the Twysdens; and before they purchased it&mdash;"in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth," as Hasted remarks<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>&mdash;"it was in the possession of
a family named Manningham."&mdash;Manningham! Our diarist slightly
alludes to a cousin of that name, "G.&nbsp;Manningham, deceased."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
The clue was vague, but at that little chink there entered light
sufficient to guide the researches of an antiquary.</p>

<p>The inscriptions on the older monuments in East Malling church
are printed in Thorpe's <i>Registrum Roffense</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> To them Mr. Hunter
had recourse, and with good success. Amongst them he found one
upon a monument<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> still standing on the north side of the chancel
of the church to a Richard Manningham, evidently a person of
importance in that neighbourhood. It is not stated in the inscription
that he was the owner of Bradbourne, but he lived at the
time when our author paid his visits thither, and his age, as given
on the monument, although not coincident with that stated by the
Diarist,&mdash;for the monument declares that Richard Manningham
died on the 25th April, 1611, in his 72nd year,&mdash;was sufficiently
near to stimulate to further inquiries. But without following Mr.
Hunter step by step it will be enough to state that from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>
inscription he went to Doctors' Commons, where, under the vicious
system of mismanagement which then prevailed, he was one of
the favoured two or three who were permitted to use the testamentary
records, whilst all other inquirers were excluded with
a most offensive disregard of courtesy. The will of Richard Manningham
helped on the inquiry very considerably. It was further
advanced by an heraldic Visitation of Kent, and was finally and
triumphantly concluded by an inspection of the register-books of the
Middle Temple.</p>

<p>Without derogating in the slightest degree from the merit of Mr.
Hunter's investigations, or desiring to deprive his memory of one
atom of the credit which attaches to it on that account, we prefer to
state the facts respecting the Manninghams in words of our own,
which will enable us to weave into the narrative some additions to
the results of Mr. Hunter's inquiries.</p>

<p>About the middle of the sixteenth century the Manninghams were
a numerous family of the middle class,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> branches of which were
scattered about in various parts of England. The Richard Manningham
of the monument at East Malling was born at St. Alban's;
Robert Manningham, descended from a stock which removed out of
Bedfordshire into Cambridgeshire, lived and died at Fen Drayton
in that county; George Manningham dwelt in Kent, and from the
marriages of his female descendants in that county there probably
sprang the numerous cousinred of the family to which we have
already alluded. Their <i>status</i> in Kent before Richard Manningham
settled at Bradbourne may be inferred from one fact which appears
in the Diary, namely, that George Manningham was bound as surety
with William Somner, father of the well known antiquary of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span>
Canterbury, for the father's performance of the duties of the registrarship
of the Ecclesiastical Court, in which office he preceded
his son.</p>

<p>Richard, Robert, and George Manningham are all stated to have
been relations, and probably they all stood about upon a par in
worldly circumstances, but Richard pursued a way of life which
enabled him to shoot ahead of all the members of his family. Of his
youth we have no particulars, but he was well educated even according
to present notions. He united an acquaintance with modern
languages to the share of classical knowledge taught in our old
grammar-schools, and is commemorated as having spoken and
written Latin, French, and Dutch, with freedom and elegance, <a name="tn_png_10"></a><!--TN: Second "and" removed-->and
as having been able at the age of sixty-two to repeat <i>memoriter</i>
almost the whole of the first and second books of the Æneid.</p>

<p>Brought up to some branch of commerce, he was a member of the
Mercers' Company of London, and in his business days resided in
the metropolis, but age found him with a competency, and brought
with it some customary infirmities. He retired from London, purchased
the quiet sheltered Bradbourne, and passed the evening of his
days in occupations in which literature bore a considerable share.</p>

<p>He was twice married; the first time to a native of Holland, a
family connection of the Lady Palavicini, afterwards wife of Sir
Oliver Cromwell, the uncle of the future Protector.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> This marriage
was a happy one. The lady survived the purchase of Bradbourne,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and
was buried in the church of East Malling. Richard Manningham's
second match was with a Kentish widow. The traces we find of
her in the Diary do not leave an impression that she added much
to her husband's happiness. She is not alluded to in his will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
We may therefore conclude that she died between 1602 and 1611.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
There is no mention of issue by either marriage.</p>

<p>Childless, solitary, and infirm, Richard Manningham was in no
degree misanthropic. Out of his abundance he applied considerable
sums in charity, and for the benefit of his kindred, and at an early
period looked around for a Manningham who might inherit the
principal portion of his property and carry on his name. His
choice fell upon John Manningham, a son of Robert of Fen
Drayton, and his wife Joan, a daughter of John Fisher of Bledlow
in the county of Bedford. That person is our Diarist.</p>

<p>Richard Manningham carried out the obligations of this adoption
in the most liberal way. It is obvious from the Diary that John
Manningham, whom Richard Manningham designated by the several
titles of "cousin," "kinsman," and "son in love," received a generous
education of the best kind. He was intended for the practice of the
law, and on the 16th March, 1597-8, was entered of the Middle
Temple, as the son and heir of Robert Manningham of Fen Drayton,
gentleman, deceased. John Chapman, probably the same person
who is mentioned in the Diary as one of the cousins who lived at
Godmersham,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> and John Hoskyns, were the members of the Inn who
were his sureties upon his admission.</p>

<p>On the 7th June 1605, having kept his exercises and been on
the books for the needful seven years, he was called to the degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
an utter barrister; whether afterwards advanced to the dignity of
being permitted to plead in actual causes in court does not appear.</p>

<p>Whilst in the Temple he had for his chamber-fellow Edward
Curle, son of William Curle, a retainer of Sir Robert Cecil, who procured
him to be appointed one of the auditors of the Court of
Wards. Several persons of this family are quoted in the Diary, and
the close relationship of chamber-fellow ripened not merely into
lasting friendship with Edward Curle, and with his brother Walter,
who afterwards became Bishop of Winchester, but into affection
towards their sister Anne. John Manningham and Anne Curle
were married probably about 1607. A son was born to them in
1608, who was named Richard after the <i>quasi</i>-grandfather at Bradbourne.
Two other sons were subsequently named John and Walter,
and three daughters, Susanna, Anne, and Elizabeth. Where
John Manningham lived after he quitted the Temple, whether in
London with a view to practice at the Bar, at Hatfield which was the
place of residence of the Curles, or at Bradbourne with his "father
in love," then a second time a widower, does not appear.</p>

<p>On the 3rd January 1609-10, the old merchant proved the reality
of his assumed fatherhood by executing a deed of gift to John
Manningham of the mansion-house of Bradbourne and the lands surrounding
it in East Malling, and two years afterwards, on the 21st
January, being, as he states, "in tolerable health of body in regard
of mine age and infirmities," he made his will. It confirmed, "if
needful," the deed of gift to John Manningham, appointed him sole
executor, and with some slight exceptions and the charge of a considerable
number of legacies, most of them tokens of remembrance,
gave him all the residue of his property. The multitude
of the old man's legacies and not less so their character tell
of his continuing interest in the connections of his past life.
They read like the last utterances of a warm and affectionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
spirit casting back its glance upon those from whom it was about
to part; whilst his adjuration to his adopted son to discharge
the amounts with punctuality, although deformed by the verbiage
of legal formality, and smacking a little of the mercantile estimate
of the indispensable importance of payment on the very day, is not
devoid of real solemnity. Omitting some of the tautologous expressions
it reads thus:&mdash;"I charge John Manningham, by all the
love and duty which he oweth me, for all my love and liberality
which I have always borne [to] him and his heretofore, but chiefly
in this my will, that he pay every legacy within six months after
my death, those excepted that are appointed to be paid at certain
days, and those to be duly paid at their days appointed, as my
trust is in him, and as he will answer afore God and me at the latter
day!" Nor is the pious close of the document without a share of
true impressiveness:&mdash;"Having thus, I thank God, finished my
will, and set an order in my worldly affairs, I will henceforward
await God's will to depart hence in peace, most humbly beseeching
him that when the day of my dissolution shall be come, I may by
his grace be armed with a true and lively faith, firm hope, and constant
patience, and be ready to forsake all to go to my blessed
Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ. Amen, good Lord!"</p>

<p>He had not long to wait. His will was dated, as we have remarked,
on the 21st January, 1611-12. On the 25th of the following
April,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Richard Manningham entered into his rest, and John Manningham
into possession as adopted heir. On the following 1st of
May he proved the will of his "father in love" at Doctors' Commons.</p>

<p>The few particulars we have been able to gather of the course of
this family after the death of Richard Manningham are little more
than a brief register of dates. On the 16th April 1617, William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Curle the father died. He was interred in Hatfield church, where
a monument commemorates his fidelity as a public officer, his good-fortune
in his children and friends, and his calm and happy death.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>In 1619, John Philipot, York Herald, made a Visitation for Kent
as Deputy for Camden, the Clarencieux. On this occasion John
Manningham registered his arms and pedigree. It is observable
that he did not introduce into it the descent of his cousin Richard
Manningham from their common ancestor, nor even his name.
If the Visitation may be depended upon we may infer that between
the time when the return was made and the 21st January
1621-2, when John Manningham made his own will, he lost his
daughter Anne by death, and his youngest son, to whom he gave
the name of his brother-in-law Walter, was born. Before the same
day his other brother-in-law and chamber-fellow Edward Curle
had also died. The last trace we have found of him is in 1613.</p>

<p>In the will of John Manningham to which we have just alluded,
and which it will be observed was dated like that of his predecessor on
a 21st January, he described himself as of "East Malling, esquire,"
and devised Bradbourne and all the lands derived from his "late dear
cousin and father in love" Richard Manningham, "who for ever," he
remarks, "is gratefully to be remembered by me and mine," to his
widow for life and after her decease entailed the same on his three sons
in succession. He gave to his daughter Susanna a marriage portion
of 300<i>l.</i>; to Elizabeth, 250<i>l.</i>; to the little Benjamin of his flock, the
young Walter, anything but a Benjamin's share of 100<i>l.</i>; and to his
executors 20 nobles a piece; all the rest of his personalty he divided
between his widow and his eldest son. He named as executors Dr.
Walter Curle, who had then ascended upon the ladder of preferment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
to the Deanery of Lichfield, and John Manningham's cousin, Dr.
William Roberts of Enfield. The Will was proved on the 4th December,
1622, by Dr. Curle alone, Dr. Roberts having renounced.</p>

<p>Two further facts bring to an end the brief glimmerings we have
been able to discover respecting the third generation of the Manninghams
at Bradbourne.</p>

<p>Bishop Walter Curle made his will on the 15th March 1646-7, and
left to his nephew and godson Walter Manningham a sum of 50<i>l.</i>
To the boy's mother&mdash;"my loving sister <a name="tn_png_15"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Mrs"-->Mrs. Anne Manningham,"
the Bishop left "a piece of plate of twenty ounces."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>Nine years afterwards the "loving sister" had followed the Bishop
into the better land. Where she was buried does not appear, certainly
not at East Malling. Bradbourne then fell to the second
Richard Manningham, who sold it in 1656 to Mr. Justice Twysden,
in whose family it still remains. Thus drops the curtain upon the
connexion of the Manninghams with East Malling.</p>

<p>Other persons of the same name appear in the succeeding century,
one on the episcopal bench as Bishop of Chichester, from 1709 to
1722, and his son Sir Richard Manningham as a distinguished physician
and discoverer of the fraud of Mary Tofts the rabbit-breeder,
but their connexion with the subjects of our inquiry does not very
clearly appear.</p>

<p>Turn we now from the Diarist and his family to the Diary. It
was written by John Manningham whilst a student in the Middle
Temple, and runs through the year 1602 down to April in 1603,
Occasionally, as we have remarked in one of our notes, some few of
the entries are out of chronological order, either from mistake of the
binder or irregularity of the Diarist. In some cases it clearly arose
from the habit of the latter of making his entries in any part of the
book where there happened to be a vacant space. The consequences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
are of so little moment that we have thought it best in printing
to follow the order of the original MS. as it now stands.</p>

<p>Chronological sequence is the less important as the book is scarcely
what is generally understood by a Diary. It is rather a note-book
in which the writer has jotted down from time to time his impressions
of whatever he chanced to hear, read, or see, or whatever he
desired to preserve in his memory. The result is a curious patchwork.
Anecdotes, witticisms, aphoristic expressions, gossip, rumours,
extracts from books, large notes of sermons, occasional memoranda
of journeys into Kent and Huntingdonshire, with some little personal
matter of the true Diary kind, are all thrown together into a
miscellany of odds and ends.</p>

<p>Our Diarist could not have lived in a better place than in an Inn
of Court for the compilation of such a book. The common dinner
and the common supper, the less formal gatherings at the buttery-bar
and around the hall fire, and in the summer time the exercise
taken in the pleasant garden&mdash;an indispensable accompaniment of an
Inn of Court&mdash;brought together multitudes of the "unbaked and
doughy youth of the nation," full of life and spirit, most of them
under training for legal practice or public business, and sparkling
with all the freshness and volatility, the exuberance and glow which
distinguish the opening of young wits. This was the very place to
furnish materials for such a note-book as we have described. Among
such companions the <i>bon mot</i> of the bar, the scandal of the Court,
the tittle-tattle of the town, were the very <i>pabulum</i> of their daily
conversation. A witty sarcasm would tell among students not "past
the bounds of freakish youth" with infinite effect, and it mattered
little&mdash;such was the universal freedom of language and manners in
those days&mdash;how literal the expression, or to what kind of subject it
related. Perhaps even additional zest was given to a pithy speech
by its want of reserve in relation to transactions which we have
come to regard as better left untalked about. Neither was there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
found any greater difficulty in writing about such matters than in
speaking of them. The line of stars which occasionally will be
found stretching across our page indicates the occurrence of passages
which principally on this ground we have deemed it unadvisable to
print.</p>

<p>The time in which our Diarist wrote was distinguished by one
event of surpassing interest&mdash;the death of the great Queen who had
ruled the country for more than forty years. In reference to that
event he possessed peculiar opportunities of acquiring information,
and what he has told us is essentially of historical authority. His
channel of communication with the Court was Dr. Henry Parry,
subsequently Bishop of Gloucester and afterwards of Worcester,
at that time one of her Majesty's chaplains and on duty in that
character at the Queen's death. On the 23rd March 1602-3, the
rumours respecting her Majesty's health were most alarming. The
public were even doubtful whether she was actually alive. In
satisfaction of his curiosity our Diarist proceeded to the palace at Richmond,
where the great business was in progress. He found assembled
there the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Keeper, and
others of the highest official dignitaries. The Queen still lived, and
the ordinary daily religious services were still kept up within
the sombre palace. Dr. Parry preached before the assembled visitors,
and our Diarist was permitted to be one of the audience. The
sermon was as little connected as could be with the urgent circumstances
which must have drawn off the thoughts of his congregation,
but in the preacher's prayers both before and after his discourse
he interceded for her Majesty so fervently and pathetically, that
few eyes were dry.</p>

<p>Service over, Manningham dined in the privy chamber with Dr.
Parry and a select clerical company, who recounted to him the
particulars of the Queen's illness; how for a fortnight she had been
overwhelmed with melancholy, sitting for hours with eyes fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
upon one object, unable to sleep, refusing food and medicine, and
until within the last two or three days declining even to go to bed.
It was the opinion of her physicians that if at an early period she
could have been persuaded to use means she would unquestionably
have recovered, but she would not, "and princes," our Diarist
remarks, "must not be forced." Her fatal obstinacy brought her at
length into a condition which was irremediable. For two days she
had lain "in a manner speechless, very pensive and silent,"&mdash;dying
of her own perverseness. When roused she showed by signs that
she still retained her faculties and memory, but the inevitable hour was
fast approaching. The day before, at the instance of Dr. Parry, she
had testified by gestures her constancy in the Protestantism "which
she had caused to be professed," and had hugged the hand of the
archbishop when he urged upon her a hopeful consideration of the
joys of a future life. In these particulars our Diarist takes us nearer
to the dying bed of the illustrious Queen than any other writer with
whom we are acquainted.</p>

<p>Dr. Parry remained with the Queen to the last. It was amidst
his prayers that about three o'clock in the morning which followed
Manningham's visit to the palace she ceased to breathe.</p>

<p>For the last few years the public mind had been disturbed by
claims put forth on behalf of a multitude of pretenders to the now
empty throne. The people had been bewildered and alarmed by
the production of no less than fourteen different titles advanced on
behalf of a number of separate claimants. A strong impression prevailed
that on the Queen's death a struggle was inevitable&mdash;that the
long peace which the country had owed to the Tudors would come
to an end with them. The vacancy had now occurred, and every
one was anxious to know in what manner the claimants would
prefer their claims, and who would arbitrate amongst their clashing
interests? Above all things, as likely to involve the most important
changes, what course would be taken by the Roman Catholics? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
seemed a great opportunity for them, so great that no one imagined
they would allow it to slip past.</p>

<p>The statements of our Diarist at this time are of particular interest.
The ministers of the late Queen acted with equal promptitude and
prudence. Sir Robert Cecil had settled the matter long ago, and
all his fellow-ministers now concurred in what he had done. Not
an instant was lost; at the very earliest moment, at day-break, in
less than four hours after the Queen had ceased to breathe at Richmond,
a meeting of the Council was held at Whitehall. A proclamation
already prepared by Cecil, and settled by the anxious King
of Scotland, was produced and signed. At 10 o'clock the gates of
Whitehall were thrown open. Cecil, with a roll of paper in his
hand, issued forth at the head of a throng of gentlemen, and with
the customary display of tabards and blare of trumpets proclaimed
the accession of King James.</p>

<p>"The proclamation," remarks our author, "was heard with great
expectation and silent joy, no great shouting." At night there
were bonfires and ringing of bells, but "no tumult, no contradiction,
no disorder in the city; every man went about his business as
readily, as peaceably, as securely, as though there had been no
change nor any news of competitors." The quickness and unanimity
of the council, combined with the popular feeling in favour of King
James, fixed him at once in the new dignity. Opponents were overawed
and silenced when they found that the supporters of the King
had as it were stolen a march upon them, and that, although he
himself was absent, his friends were in possession of all the powers
of government on his behalf. The previous agitation subsided
almost instantly. The disturbed sea rocked itself to rest.</p>

<p>From this time general anxiety was directed towards the North.
"The people is full of expectation, and great with hope of our new
King's worthiness, of our nation's future greatness; every one
promises himself a share in some famous action to be hereafter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
performed for his prince or country." The anticipations which
the people framed for themselves from the change of sex in their
new governor, from the change of age, and from the ambition which
they imagined would be developed in him by his transference from
a small rough unsettled country to one which by forty years of
steady government had acquired a unity, a solidity, a definite and
noble position among the nations of the world, of which all true
Englishmen were proud, have no where been brought so clearly
before us, as in the pages of our Diarist. Such anticipations were
like the fire of brushwood. It is painful to think of the disappointment
to which they were doomed.</p>

<p>Besides these events of an historical character, there are scattered
through the Diary a multitude of notices of persons of less social
position than Elizabeth and James, but not by any means of less
interest. Living among lawyers, it was of course that many of the
young student's notes would relate to them. But many of the
lawyers of that day, both those who had earned the honours of their
profession and those who still remained <i>in statu pupillari</i>, were
men about whom we can never learn too much. In these notes we
have glimpses of Sir Thomas More, of Bacon, Coke, Lord Keeper
Egerton, of Judges Anderson, Manwood, and Catline, of the merry
old Recorder Fleetwood, of his graver successor Croke, and of the
beggar's friend, Sir Julius Cæsar. Among the younger men we
may notice Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, the future Lord Chief Justice
Bramston, and the man who in the coming stormy times was for
a period more prominent than them all, the statesman Pym. It
will be seen in a note at <a href="#Page_104">p. 104</a>, that the publication of this volume
has given an opportunity for the settlement of the question, whether
Pym had what may be termed a regular legal education, which his
biographers have left in doubt. The Middle Temple has clearly the
high honour of reckoning him upon their roll.</p>

<p>Of non-legal persons who are here brought before us with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
or less prominency, we need scarcely allude to the entries relating
to Shakespeare and the performance of his Twelfth Night, which
were first noticed by Mr. Collier, and have been used by every subsequent
writer on dramatic subjects. The unfortunate Overbury
comes before us several times, such as we should have expected to
find him, inconsiderate and impetuous. Ben Jonson flits across the
page. Of Marston there is a disagreeable anecdote which has not
been left unnoticed by poetical antiquaries. Sir Thomas Bodley and
Lord Deputy Mountjoy are alluded to. There is an excellent account
of an interview with old Stowe the antiquary, a valuable glimpse of
the Cromwell family during the boyhood of the Protector, and
references, some of them of importance, to Sir Walter Raleigh, to
his foolish friend Lord Cobham, to the wizard Earl of Northumberland,
and of course many allusions to the Cecils, both to Sir William,
and to that youngest son to whom, according to the joke which is
here preserved, his father's wisdom descended as if it had been held
by the tenure of Borough-English.</p>

<p>One peculiarity of this Diary is the very large proportion of it
which is given up to notes of sermons. There is something in this
which is characteristic of the time as well as of the writer. It was
a sermon-loving age, and that to a degree which it is scarcely possible
for us to understand in our degenerate days. Another thing
which is equally at variance with modern notions is that, when
reading the original manuscript, we pass at once from passages
which we have been obliged to reject as unfit for publication to
notes of pulpit addresses which inculcate a high-toned morality based
upon those sound principles which apply even to the thoughts and
feelings. It is clear that the incongruity in this contrast which
is painful to us was not then perceived. The coarseness of the popular
language on the one hand, and the affection for pulpit addresses,
even among students of the Inns of Court, on the other, were both
parts of what we are accustomed to term the manners of the age,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
and, like all things universally accepted, their rights and wrongs
were never very minutely criticised. The language we have objected
to is of course entirely indefensible. It was the slough of a
coarser generation, which our ancestors had not then entirely cast
off.</p>

<p>Of many of the sermons as represented in these notes we think
highly, but we have printed the whole of them in smaller type, so
that they may be distinguished at a glance, and if there be any of
our readers to whom they are less acceptable, they may be easily
passed over.</p>

<p>Among the preachers who are here commemorated will be found
some of the most celebrated divines of the day;&mdash;Dr. Lancelot
Andrewes, Dr. James Montague, Dr.<a name="tn_png_022"></a><!--TN: Period added after "Dr"--> John Buckeridge, Dr. John
King, Dr. Parry, and Dr. George Abbot, none of them yet Bishops;
Andrew Downes the Grecian; Dr. Thomas Holland, Regius Professor
of Divinity at Oxford; Dr. Giles Thompson, afterwards Dean
of Windsor; with two fervid orators, frowned upon by many of their
brethren, but most influential with the people,&mdash;one of them Mr.
Egerton, whose congregation assembled "in a little church or chapel
up stairs" in Blackfriars, and the other Mr. Clapham, who was the
incumbent of a church at Paul's Wharf.</p>

<p>In notes, for the most part very skilfully taken,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of sermons of
men so various in their acquirements, and many of them so eminently
distinguished, we have examples of the pulpit oratory of the age,
with evidences of the nature of the doctrines then generally prevalent
in the Church of England, and of some of the qualities which
tended to make the preaching of those doctrines popular.</p>

<p>Nor is the book devoid of notices of many other circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>stances
which were characteristical of the time. The following are
examples. At <a href="#Page_22">p. 22</a> we find an account of the operation of lithotomy,
stated to be then first brought into medical practice; at
<a href="#Page_46">p. 46</a> we learn that "a certain kind of compound called
<i>Laudanum</i>" had been recently introduced as the chloroform, and
at <a href="#Page_132">p. 132</a> that the game of shuttlecock was the croquet, of
the day. In another place (<a href="#Page_110">p. 110</a>) the fantastical and affectedly
humble salutation to the knee alluded to by dramatists of the period
is said to have been one of the many changes in fashion attributed
to English travellers returned from Italy. At <a href="#Page_36">p. 36</a> there is a
notice of an article apparently of fashionable costume which we
are unable to explain, "Kentish tails." It is said of these things,
whatever they were, that they "are now turned to such spectacles, so
that if a man put them on his nose he shall have all the land he can
see." What connection, if any, there may be between the tails here
mentioned and the old legend of Kentish tails, we are obliged to
leave to the consideration of persons versed in the antiquities of that
county.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> There are other passages which deal with the fashions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
of the day. It was a time in which ladies' dressing-rooms were
nearly allied to apothecaries' shops, and the art of manufacturing
female beauty seems to have fallen into the hands of probably a
lower and irregular class of medical practitioners. The poets are
full of allusions to this subject. Massinger sums it up in a passage
which we may be excused for quoting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="centerpoem">
<div class="poem">
<span class="i14">there are ladies<br></span>
<span class="i0">And great ones, that will hardly grant access,<br></span>

<span class="i0">That would be still young in despite of time;<br></span>

<span class="i0">As if it were within the power of art<br></span>
<span class="i0">To frame a second nature.<br></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The anecdotes jotted down by the young Templar speak for themselves.
They of course derive their principal value from the names
to which they are attached. Notices of personal peculiarities are so
singularly evanescent, they live so entirely in the observation and
memory of contemporaries, that it is a biographical gain to have
them recorded in any shape. Apparent trifles, such as the waddling
gait of Sir John Davies, the stately silence of Lord Montjoy at the
dinner table, the description of the popular preacher Clapham&mdash;"a
black fellow with a sour look but a good spirit, bold and sometimes
bluntly witty," the fussy particularity of Fleetwood the recorder,
the vanity of old Stowe,&mdash;these, and memoranda such as these, impart
a life and reality to our conceptions of the men to whom they
relate, which cannot be derived from volumes of mere dates and
facts.</p>

<p>Of the recorded witticisms, the peculiarity which will strike the
reader in this case, as in all others of the same description, is their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
singular want of originality. Good things which were current in
the classical period are here re-invented, or warmed up, for the
amusement of the contemporaries of King James. And the same
thing occurs over and over again, from generation to generation.
<i>Mots</i> which descended to the times of Manningham reappeared
in the pages of Joe Miller, are recorded among the clever sayings of
Archbishop Whateley, and in one instance at least may be found
among the pulpit witticisms of Rowland Hill.</p>

<p>The book is one which would bear a large amount of illustrative
annotation. We have endeavoured in most cases to keep down
what we had to say to mere citation of the ordinary standard books
of reference&mdash;the tools with which all literary men work. It is well
for them that our literature can boast of instruments so well suited to
their purpose as Dr. Bliss's edition of Wood's Athenæ, Mr. Hardy's
edition of Le Neve's Fasti, and Mr. Foss's Lives of the Judges&mdash;the
books to which we have principally referred. May the number of
such works be increased!</p>

<p>Finally, we have the grateful task of returning thanks to two gentlemen
who have specially assisted us in issuing this book. To Mr.
John Forster, the author of the Life of Eliot and of many other
valuable historical works, we are indebted for the use of a transcript
of part of the Diary here printed; and to Mr. John Gough Nichols,
like the Editors of most of the volumes printed for the Camden
Society, we owe the great advantage of many most useful suggestions
during the progress of the work. The results of their kindness
and of the liberality of Mr. Tite will we hope be acceptable to
the Society.</p>

<h3><span class="sidehead">fo. 5.</span><span class="smcap">Marche 28, 1602.</span><a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></h3>

<p>At the Temple: sermon, the text, Mark, x. 20.</p>

<p>Notes: All the commandementes must be observed with like respect.
It is not sufficient to affect one and leave the rest vnrespect, for that
were to make an idoll of that precept. Obedience must be seasoned with
love; yf any other respect be predominat in our actions, as feare of
punishment, desyre of estimacion &amp;c. they are out of temper.</p>

<p>Christ propoundes these commaundementes of the 2nd table, because, yf
a man cannot observe these, he shall never be able to keepe them of the
first, for yf a man love not his neighbor whom he hath seene, howe shall
he love God whom he hath not seene?</p>

<p>And he that is bound to observe the lesse must keepe the greater commaundement.</p>

<p>The doctrine of justificacion consistes upon these pillars, 1. <i>Ex merito,
si non ex condigno at ex congruo.</i> 2. And this upon free-will, for noe
merrit with<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> a free agent. 3. And this upon a possibilitie of keeping the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
commaundementes, for <i>liberum arbitrium</i> is a power of performing what wee
would and should, and <i>libertas voluntatis</i> and <i>liberum arbitrium</i> are severall.</p>

<p>Noe man can performe anie any action soe well but he shall fayle either
in the goodnes of the motion efficient, the meanes, or end.</p>

<p>Justificacion by workes is but old Pharisaisme and newe Papisme;
<span class="sidenote">fo. 5<sup>b</sup>.</span>the Papists distinguishe and make <i>Justiciam legalem</i> and <i>evangelicam</i>;
the 1. in performance of outward required accions; the 2. in the intent
supplied [?]</p>

<p>All the sacrifices that God was most delighted with are for the most
part sayd to be young, a lambe, &amp;c. and the exhortacion of him which was
more the agent and more learned than anie, for he was a King and the
wisest that ever was, is, Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy
youth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There is a generall and a speciall love of Christ wherewith he embraceth
men; the 1. is here ment and mentioned, and with that he loves
all which doe but endeauour to be morally good; soe doubteles he loved
Aristides for his justice, which was a work of God in him, and so being a
good, God could not but love it, and him for it.</p>

<p>But the speciall is that whereby he makes us heires of eternall lyfe, and
adoptes vs for his children.</p>

<p>Beholding him, God regardes the least perfections or rather imperfect
affections in us; he will not breake a crazed reede.</p>

<p>Note: The breade in the sacrament becoming a nourishment is a
medicine to our whole bodye.</p>

<p>The manner of receyving Christes body in the sacrament; as to make a
question of it by way of doubting, is dangerous, soe to enquire of it to
knowe it is relligious.</p>

<p>Wee receive it<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> <i>non per consubstantialitatem sed per germanissimam societatem</i>.

<p>It must be received with five fingers, the first the hand, the 2. the understanding,
3. fayth, 4. application, 5. affection and joy; and this makes it a

<p>Of pleasure. <i>Momentaneum est quod delectat, æternum quod cruciat.</i></p>

<p>It is better to eate fishes with Christ, then a messe of pottage with
Esau.</p>

<p><i>Nil turpius quam plus ingerrere quam possis digerere.</i></p>

<p>The glutton eates like a dogge, and lives like a hogg, having his soule
as salt onely to keepe his body from stinkinge.</p>

<p>He that filleth his body emptieth his soule.</p>

<p><i>Id pro Deo colitur quod præ omnibus diligitur.</i></p>

<p><i>Vtinam</i>, sayth Augustine, <i>tam finiatur quam definitur ebrietas</i>.</p>

<p>Bacchus painted yonge, because he makes men like children, vnable to
goe or speake, naked because discouers all.</p>

<p>It is noe better excuse for a drunkard to say that it was his owne
that he spent, then yf one should say he would cut his owne throate, for
the knife that should doe it is his owne.</p>

<p>Drunkennes is the divells birding synne; the drunkard like the stale
that allures other to be taken like it selfe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Matt. 12.</p>

<p>Envie and mallice will barke though it be so musselled that it cannot bite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 7.</div>

<p>It is almost divine perfection to resist carnall affection.</p>

<p>When wee censure other men wee should imitate that good imitator of
nature Apelles, whoe being to drawe a face of an great person<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> which wanted
an eye, drewe that syde only which was perfect.</p>

<p>The malicious man is like the vultur, which passeth ouer manie sweete
gardens and never rests but vpon some carrion or garbage, soe he neuer
takes notice of anie thing but vices.</p>

<p>Libellers are the divels herauldes.</p>

<p><i>Invidus alienum bonum suum facit peccando malum.</i></p>

<p>Envy, though in all other respectes it be a thing most execrable, yet in
this it is in some sort commendable, that it is a vexacion to it selfe. It
is like gunpowder, which consumes itselfe before it burnes the house. Or
the fly <i>pyrausta</i>, which would put out the candle, but burns itselfe.</p>

<p>Honor is like a buble, which is raysed with one winde and broken
with an other.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Mr. Downes.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></h3>

<p>The love of the world is the divels eldest sonne.</p>

<p>Honour, riches, and pleasure are the worldly mans trynitie, wherewith
he committs spirituall idolatry.</p>

<p>Thankefullnes is like the reflex of the sunne beame from a bright bodie.</p>

<p>After a full tyde of prosperitie cometh a lowe ebbe of adversitie. After
a day of pleasure a night of sorrowe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 7<sup>b</sup>.</div>

<p>Honour is like a spiders webbe, long in doinge, but soone vndone,
blowne downe with every blast. It is like a craggy steepe rocke, which a
man is longe getting vpon, and being vp, yf his foote but slip, he breakes
his necke. Soe the Jewes dealt with Christ; one day they would have him
a king, an other day none; one day cryed Hosanna to him, an other nothing
but crucifie him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>The world is like an host; when a man hath spent all, body, goodes, and
soule with it, it will not vouchsafe to knowe him.</p>

<p>Laban chose rather to loose his daughters than his idols, and the riche
man had rather forsake his soule then his riches.</p>

<p>If a citizen of Rome made him selfe a citizen of anie other place, he
lost his priviledge at Rome; yf a man wilbe a citizen of this world, he cannot
be a citizen of heaven.</p>

<p>Ambitious men are like little children which take great paynes in runninge
vp and downe to catch butterflyes, which are nothing but painted
winges, and either perishe in takinge or fly away from them.</p>

<p>Covetous man like a child, which cryes more for the losse of a trifle
then his inheritance; he laments more for losse of wealth then soule.</p>

<p>A covetous man proud of his riches is like a theife that is proud of his
halter.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">Mr. Phillips.</h3>

<p>The proverbe is that building is a theife, because it makes us lay out
more money then wee thought on; but pride is a theife and a whore too,
for it robbes the maister of his wealth, and the mistress of her honesty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 8.</div>

<p>The drunkard makes his belly noe better then a bucking tubb, a vessell
to poure into, and put out at.</p>

<p><i>Bona opera habent mercedem, non ratione facti, sed ratione pacti.</i></p>

<p><i>Non est refugium a Deo irato, nisi ad Deum placatum.</i></p>

<p>Synn is Adams legacy bequeathed to all his posteritie: nothing more
common then to committ synn, and being committed to conceale it.</p>

<p>A concealed synn is <i>tanquam serpens in sinu, gladius in corde, venenum
in stommacho</i>; it is like a soare of the body, the closer it is kept the more
it festers.</p>

<p><i>Scelera quandoque possunt esse secreta, nunquam secura.</i></p>

<p>Confession must be <i>festina, vera, et amara</i>.</p>

<p>Confession of synne onely at the hour of death, is like a theifes confession
at the gallowes, or a traytors at the racke, when they cannot choose.</p>

<p><i>Sine confessione justus est ingratus, et peccator mortuus.</i></p>

<p>The mercy of God is never to be despayred of, but still to be expected
even <i>inter pontem et fontem, jugulum et gladium</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Dissembled righteousnes is like smoake, which seemes to mount up to

<p><i>Primum querite regnum Dei, et omnia adjicientur vobis.</i> Tullies brother,
in a sort reprehending or discouraging his suit for the consulship, tells
him that he must remember that he is <i>novus, consulatum petit</i>, and <i>Romæ
est</i>; the Devill, perhaps least any should attempt to put this precept in
practise, will terrifie us by shewinge vs our weakenes, and that greatnes.

<i>Stultus Populus Qu&oelig;rit Romam</i>, intimating they were but fooles that went

<p>Yf Christ had thought well of wealth he would not have bin soe poore

<p>Dr. Montague,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> his text Joh. iii. 14: "As Moses lift up the Serpent in
the Wildernes so must the Sonne of Man be lift up."</p>

<p>Speaches are either historicall of a thing past, propheticall of a thing
to come, legall of a thing to be done, or figurative when one thing is said
and an other ment. Figures there are in scripture, two almost peculiar,
typicall and sacramentall, the one shewing one thing by an other, the
other declaring what is conferred by another.</p>

<p>Moses had speciall commaundment to erect this Serpent, and yet God
did not dispense with the 2nd Commaundment, for this Serpent was not
made to be worshipped, but to be looked upon.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>

<p>God cannot dispense with anie commandment of the first table but he
should cease to be God, as the first, Thou shalt have none other<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Gods
but me; admit a pluralitie, and himselfe should be none, &amp;c. but with the
2nd table he often dispenseth, for those concerne man immediately.</p>

<p>The text is hystoricall, Numb. xxi. 9, and typicall. Christ resembled by
the brasen Serpent, Syn by the stinging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 9, 1602.<br>

<p>Moses while he was in the Wildernes had onely the place of a mediator
not a iudge, and therefore we read that whensoeuer the people murmured,
God punished them. But when Moses left his station, and would at any
tyme become a iudge ouer them, God neuer punished the people that
murmured, but Moses that forgot his place. Christ, vntill the latter day,
hath the place of an aduocate, but then he shalbe a iudge of the quicke
and dead.</p>

<p>Wee reade of three exaltacions of our Saviour, one upon the crosse to
purchase our pardon; 2, from the graue for the publication thereof; 3, to
heauen for the application of his resurrection; and all these were necessarilie
to be performed by him, for the consummation of our salvation.</p>

<p>The Serpent was not lifted up in the Wildernes before the people were
stung by the serpents, and Christ is not to be propounded on the Crosse
as a comfort untill the sting of Synn be felt throughly.</p>

<p>The Scripture telleth us that of all beasts the Serpent is the most
subtill, and his subtilty is obserued in three points: first, when those
nations in Syria and other hott countries found themselues often endangered
by the stinging of venomous beasts, amongst other remedies they
invented charming, which the serpent perceuinge, to auoyd their cunning
and effect his malice, he would stop both his eares, the one by laying it
close to the earth, the other by stopping it with his tayle. Soe fareth the
synner; lett the preacher speake never soe heauenly, yet will he close one
eare with worldly thoughts, and the other with fleshly imaginacions.
<span class="sidenote">May 9, 1602.<br>
fo. 19.</span>The second property of his subtilty is in defending his heade, where his lyfe
lyes, it will soe winde it selfe about that part, that [it] is a matter of greate
difficulty to cutt of a serpentes heade. In every man there is some radicall
and capitall synn, which is predominant, and this the devil endeavours by
all slightes to preserve. The third point of the serpents subtilty is ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>counted
the attractiue power which remayneth in the heade deuided from
the body, for it is proved by experience that, yf a serpent be cutt in many
peeces, yf his heade remaine aliue, yet that part will gather the rest togither
againe; soe leave the head synn alive, and it will gather a whole body
againe.</p>

<p>As Christ is the heade of the Churche he never suffered nor dyed.</p>

<p>The brasen Serpent was made like the live and true serpents in all
thinges, the sting onely excepted; Christ was made like man in all things
sauing synn.</p>

<p>All which beheld the brasen Serpent were cured; all that beleeve in
Christ are saved.</p>

<p>Remedies are either naturall, by virtue of some inherent qualitie in the
medicine applied; or by diuine influence and institution, when some
thing is effected either beyond or contrary to the force and nature of that
which is used. And this is miraculous; soe was the curing of the
blind by laying spittle and clay upon the eyes of the blinde. Soe the cure
of the lame by washing in the poole of Bethesdas, and soe the healing of
the Israelites by beholdinge the brasen Serpent.</p>

<p>Fayth properly in things beyond or contrary to reason.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May 9, 1602.<br>

<p>As by the institucion of marriage the heate of the flesh is abated, soe
by our mysticall connection with Christ the heate of syn is allayed.</p>


<h3 class="smcap">May 13. At the Temple Churche.</h3>

<p>One Moore of Baliol Colledge in Oxford; his text Amos iii. 6: "Shall
there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it?" <i>Malum culpe et malum</i>
<i>p&oelig;ne</i>; of the latter onely God is the author. God may be said to be the
author of synn permissive, and an actor in synn, though not the author of the
synne, for ther is noe action but he is the first cause of it: and yet he is
noe partner or cause of the il in the action, noe more then he which rideth
vpon a lame iade, can be said to be the cause of his limpinge, though he
be the cause of his paceinge, nor a cunning musician the cause of discordes
when he playeth on a lute that is out of tune. There is a two-fold power
in every thing, and both derived from God; the one of creacion, <span class="sidenote">May 13, 1602.<br>
fo. 20.</span>whereby
every thing worketh according to nature, as the fyre to burne, &amp;c.; and
the other of preservacion, whereby that force is continued, and if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
second be withdrawne the first perisheth, for God is not a mere efficient
externall, as the taylour of the garmente, or a carpenter of the house,
whose effects may continue though their labour continue not, but he
is an inherent continuall assistant cause, soe that yf he withdrawe his
power of preseruing the power of creacion is idle, soe the fire in furnace
could not burne the children, &amp;c.</p>

<p>One Sanders made a Sermon, his text 1 Timoth. vi. 17: "Charge
them that are riche in this world that they be not high mynded; and
that they trust not in vncertayne riches; but in the liuing God, which
giueth us abundantly all things to enioye."</p>

<p>Charge them that they lift up their soules to God in heavenly meditation,
not against God by worldly presumption.</p>

<p>Charge the riche, therefore there were diversitie of condition and estates
of men in the primitiue Churche, not all thinges common in possession, as
the Anabaptists would haue it.</p>

<p>When there came one to Pope Benedict to entreat him to make more
Cardinals, he demaunded first yf he could deuise how he might make
more worldes: for this was to litle for the Cardinals which were already.
Such ambitious covetousnes the Pope noted in those holie ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Good meate is often tymes corrupted by a bad stommache, and good
doctrine of small effect with bad hearers. Yett the minister must not
be discouraged: but proceed in his calling, that yf synn cannot be avoyded
yet it may become vnexcusable.</p>

<p>Ephesus, whereof Tymothie was Bishop, was the confluence of honour and
wealth, like our London.</p>

<p>The surgeon is not to be blamed that findes and shewes the corrupt and
rotten parts of the body, but the body which is soe corrupt as to breed
them; soe the preacher not to be disliked for reprehending our synnes, but
our selves for committing things worthy reprehension.</p>

<div class="sidenote">May, 1602.<br>
fo. 21.</div>

<p>Good things though common are not to be contemned for their
commonness, noe more then the sunne, the light, the ayre, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The vsuror sometymes looseth both his principall and interest, the
husbandman his labour and his seede, the merchant aduentures lyfe and
goods; but the profession of the preacher is subiect to greater then all
these, for he may loose both his owne and the peoples soules.</p>

<p>It is one of the most heauie judgments that God useth to threaten to
anie nation with whom he is displeased, that he will remoue their candlesticke
and send a famine of the word amongst them.</p>

<p>God made some riche, and some poore, that twoe excellent virtues
might flourishe in the world, charitie in the riche, and patience in the
poore. Pride is the sting of riches. <i>Tolle superbiam, et diuitiæ non nocebunt.</i></p>

<p>A man may speake of his owne riches, soe it be without arrogancy, for
it is a good thinge to speake of the loving kindenes of the Lord.</p>

<p>Magistrates and rich men must not be like the filling stones in a building,
but arche and corner stones, which support others.</p>

<p>When persons of meane worth thrust themselves into places beyond their
condicion and hability, it is all one as yf the rough mortar and pebles
should appeare in the roomes of the squared stones in a fayre building.</p>

<p>Themistocles said there was no musicke so sweete vnto him as to heare
his owne prayses.</p>

<p>In the primitiue Churche the riche men were soe proud that they refused
to receive the Sacrament with the poore.</p>

<p>The examples of the incertaintie of riches by often and suddain casualtyes
should be like Lott's wife to the beholders, to remember and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
avoid the like. The multitude followe the riche men, as a swarme of
bees followe a man that carries the hiue of honie combes, rather for
the love of the honie then his person, more for the love of his money then
his manhood.</p>

fo. <a name="tn_png_055"></a><!--TN: Period added after "21<sup>b</sup>"-->21<sup>b</sup>.</span><span class="smcap">At Westminster.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Androes, Deane of that Churche,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> made a Sermon, his text John
xvi. 7: "Yet I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I goe away,
for if I goe not away the Comforter will not come vnto you, but if I
depart I will send him vnto you."</p>

<p>These wordes have reference to the feast which is celebrated this day:
whereupon St. Augustine said, <i>In verbo fuit promissio missionis, et in festo
missio promissionis</i>: for soe it is in the second of the Acts. "When the
day of Pentecost was come they were all filled with the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>These words were spoken to the disciples when their hearts were full of
sorrowe that Christ must part from them, and therefore had need of
comfort, for they had cause of sorrowe, for yf a man would not willingly
be forsaken of any, as Paule complayneth 2 Tim. iv. 10, that Demas
had forsaken him, would it not greiue the disciples to [be] forsaken by
such a frend as Christ had bin vnto them, whoe in one place speaking
vnto them asketh this question, Which of you hath wanted any thing since
you followed me? And in an other place he compareth them while he continues
with them to the children of the bridechamber.</p>


<p>Besides the tyme of his departure might aggravate their sorrowes, for
it was then when he foretold soe many persecutions should come upon
<span class="sidenote">23 May, 1602.<br>
fo. 22.</span>them. And therefore here he ministers words of comfort, telling them
that is expedient, and expedient for them, that he should leaue them,
for thereby they should receive a benefit, and that of soe high a nature
as they were better to want him then it. And further for their comfort
he added, that, though he would forsake them, yet he would not leaue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
them like orphanes destitute of all frends, but would send them a Comforter.</p>

<p>And here he made his prayer, which being ended with the Lordes
prayer, he proceeded with his text: and first noted that Christ rendred a
reason of his departure, though it be not requisite alwayes that gouernors
should render a reason to their subiects of all their commaundments, for in
the 1 Sam. the Kinge gives noe other reason but it was his pleasure.
2. It is a mylde reason, not harshe like that in Marke ix. cap. 19 v. "O,
ye faythles generacion, howe long shall I bee with you, how long nowe
shall I suffer you?" but here he deliueres it meekely, and moues them
with expediency, and that not for himselfe, <i>non nobis, sed vobis expedit</i>.
And therefore because it is expedient it ought not to greive them, in soe
much as the profit they shall gayne will countervayle the pleasure which
they must forgoe by his departure.</p>

<p>And yet it might seeme strange that they should gayne by loosing him;
it is reade, <i>Dissolve c&oelig;lum et veni ad nos, Domine</i>, and againe, <i>Veni ad nos,
et mane nobiscum</i>. But to goe from them what desyre could they haue?
Here may arise three difficulties. 1. The disciples might have rejoyned,
and sayde, What neede, what care wee for any other Comforter? soe long
as you are with us, wee desyre noe other. 2. Why might not the Holy
Ghost have come, and yet Christ tarried with them; could they not be
togither? 3. Howe can it be expedient for anie to loose Christ? <span class="sidenote">23 May, 1602.<br>
fo. 22<sup>b</sup>.</span>what
comfort can there be in those wordes which tell them Christ will forsake them?</p>

<p>1. Our happiness is to be reunited to God, from whom we were fallen
by our first fathers synn; for as it is the perfection of a branche that is
broken of to be ingrafted againe that it may growe with the body, soe is
it the felicitie of man to be vnited to his Creator. And in this vnion, as
well as God must be partaker of man, soe must man be made partaker of
God, otherwise there can arise noe vnion: the former was effected by
Christ's incarnacion, and the second is perfected by the inspiration of the
Holy Ghost, whoe is as it were the connexion and loue knot of the deitie.
Christ hath as it were made his testament, and the Holie Ghost is the
executor, 1 Cor. xii. Christ is the word: and the Holy Ghost is the
seale of it, 2 Corin. i. 22. "Christ hath purchased redemption for us:"
and the Holy Ghost must give us seisin, Eph. i. 14. And in conclusion
Paule sayth, viii. Rom. 9, "He that hath not the Spirit of Christ is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
not his:" and therefore was it expedient and necessary that the Holy
Ghost should come; for, as Christ was <i>complementum legis</i>, soe is the
Holy Ghost <i>complementum Evangelii</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 May, 1602.<br>
fo. 23.</div>

<p>2. They may stand togither, they may beare one an others presence,
for the manhood of Christ was conceiued by the Holy Ghost, and the
Euangelist sayth, <i>Vidi Spiritum descendentem et manentem super eum</i>.
But yet it was expedient they should not be togither vpon the earth;
expedient, as Augustine noteth, <i>non necessitatis pondere, sed divini
consilii ordine</i>, and two reasons are given for [it] in the part of the Holy
Ghost. 1. Yf the Holy Ghost should have come downe while Christ
was upon the earth, whatsoever the Holy Ghost should have done in
his person would have bin ascribed to Christ. 2. He would have appeared
to have bin sent from the Father alone. And soe it would not have
bin so apparant that he proceeded from the Father and the Sonne bothe.</p>

<p>3. Expedient it was that Christ should depart from them, howe good
soeuer his presence was vnto them. Wee knowe that bread is the strength
of mans hart, yet sometymes it may be expedient to fast: our bloud is
the treasury of our lyfe, yet sometymes it is expedient to loose it; our
eyesight is deare and precious vnto us, yet sometymes it is expedient to sitt
in a darke roome. And here it is expedient that Christ should withdrawe
his presence, not corporal onely, but his invisible presence of grace alsoe.
1. It is expedient that children which growe fond of their parentes should
be weaned. The Apostles were to full of carnall and terrene cogitacions
even after his resurrection; they asked him, Wilt thou restore the Kingdome
to Israell? therefore nowe it was highe tyme they should put of
childishnes and be taught, as Paule sayth that henceforth they knowe him
<span class="sidenote">23 May, 1602.<br>
fo. 23<sup>b</sup>.</span>no more in the fleshe; and this must be effect[ed] by withdrawing his corporall
presence, which they began to dote upon; and for the taking away
the presence of his grace, that was expedient alsoe. 1. Least being to full
they should begin to loath it, as the Children of Israel did manna in the
wildernes. And upon this reason did the prophet threaten a famine of
the word when the people, being full, contemned it. 2. That they should not
growe proud with abundaunce; the Psalmist sayth, "Yf I say I cannot be
removed," and "It is good that I was in trouble, for before I went wronge."
Peter was soe sure and confident upon himselfe, that yf all the world
should haue forsaken Christ, he would not, and therefore because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
stoode soe much vpon himselfe it was expedient that suche a swollen
bladder should be prickt, as he was till he denied and forswore his master;
And even this withdrawing of grace was a kind of grace, that seing his
owne weaknes he might possesse his soule in humility, with[out] which
there is noe grace to be expected. And therefore, <i>expedit superbo vt
in peccatum incidat</i>. And to this purpose are these wordes of Paule
that the messengers of Sathan, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> temptacions, were sent to punish
him, least he should growe proud.</p>

<p>Christ is our advocate in defending vs when the Divel accuseth vs
falsely; he is our intercessor and mediator by pleading a pardon for vs
when Sathen layes his greatest and truest accusations against us; he is
our high priest to offer sacrifice for vs.</p>

<p>Christ left them not as orphanes, but sent another unto them whoe was
equall with himselfe, otherwise they should have loss by the change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">23 May, 1602.<br>
fo. 24.</div>

<p>The Holy Ghost hath diuers offices and soe diuers effects: he enlightens
the understandinge, and soe is called the Spirit of truth: he certifies the
will, and soe is named the Spirit of Holines: he delivers from the
bondage of Sathan, and soe is the Spirit of comfort, which is the cheife
and very consummacion of all. The Holy Ghost is not given to all in
the same measure, nor the same manner. When Christ breathed vpon
his disciples they received the Holy Ghost; and, when the Holy Ghost
came like fyrey tongues, they were filled with him: breath was warme,
but fyre is hotter: there was heate in both, but not equally. Elias prayed
that the Spirit of [Elijah] might be doubled upon him.</p>

<p>The gifts of the Holy Ghost are obteyned and perfected divers wayes;
vnderstanding and fayth by the word which is the truthe; holynes of lyfe,
by prayer, meditation, and good workes; consolation by receiving the
sacraments.</p>

<p>The fyre from Heaven which consumed the sacrifices in the old lawe
was preserved by continuall addicion of fuell, soe the heauenly virtue of
Chrystian charitie being kindled in the hart of man, must be preserved
by continuall meditacions on the word of God. Yf any should aske why
it was commaunded in Leviticus that the people should offer <i>primitias</i>
and in Exodus that they should alsoe give <i>decimas</i>, I should make no
other answer, but that wee should not onely remember our Creator in the
days of our youth, but alsoe serue him in holines and righteousnes all
the dayes of our lyfe.</p>

<p><i>Aliud est incepisse, aliud perfecisse.</i></p>

<p>Some in their liues, like the image in Nebuchadnethers dreame, Dan. ii.,

<p>The Diuel laboureth most against our perseveraunce because that virtue
onely hath a promise of coronacion.</p>

<p>There be but seven steps in the ladder that leades downe to hell, and
the lowest, saving desperacion, is a custom of synning.</p>

perseveraunce consisteth in <i>patiendo et faciendo</i>: in <i>patiendo</i>, 2<sup>o</sup>, in <i>ferendo

<p>Christ compared Christian profession to a plough. And why, 1. to soe
base a thing, 2. to soe laborious a thing, 3. to that onely? 1. That none
howe base soever by condicion or profession should despayre of attayning
Heaven; and meane thinges may be compared with the greatest. Christ
sayth the Kingdom of Heaven is like a litle leaven, and to a smaller thing
then that, it is like a grayne of mustard seede; and here to a plough, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
none might despayre. Simon a tanner, Peter a fisher, Paul a tent-maker,
Joseph a carpenter.</p>

<p>Some great ones, Theophilus. Some ladyes, in the Acts. Some customers,
and some from the beggars, as Lazarus. And yet, that rich men
might not contemne it for the baseness, he compares it to a riche jewell,
a precious stone, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><span class="sidehead">June 20, 1602.<br>
fo. 27<sup>b</sup>.</span><span class="smcap">At Paules, one of Baliol Colledge in Oxford.</span></h3>

<p>His text iii. Jonah, 4 et 5. "Yet forty dayes and Niniuy shall be destroyed.
5. So the people of Nineueh beleeued God," &amp;c. He diuided his
text into Jonahs sermon to the people of Nineueh, and the peoples repentaunce
at the sermon; the former consists of mercy, "yett fourty dayes,"
and justice, "and Nineueh shall be destroyed;" Gods patience and his
iudgment. He might have sayd, as the prophet David sayd, "My song
shall be of mercy and iudgment."</p>

<p>Four things in the effect of the Sermon; fayth in beleuing God, and that
was not fruitles. 2. fasting, and that was not frivolous. 3. their attyre,
that was not costly, but sack cloth. 4. their number, that was not small,
from the greatest to the lowest. As Noah's doue came from the floud
with an oliue braunch in the mouth, soe this heauenly dove (for soe
Jonah signifieth) came from the waters of the sea with a sermon of mercy
in his cry, "Yett fourty dayes."</p>

<p>God is pitifull; it was Christ's commaundement to his Apostles that
they should say "Peace be vnto you" when they entred into anie house.</p>



<p>Noted by Jonahs crying in the middest of such a city, that the preachers
must not be timerous to tell anie of their faults, nor feare the person of
anie man. Yet he reprehended those which are to sharpe reprehenders
without circumstaunce. Such as Bernard calleth <i>non correptores, sed
corrosores</i>, such may be termed <i>bilis et salsugo</i>, like the people of India
which are said to barke instead of speakinge; <span class="sidenote">20 June, 1602.<br>
fo. 28.</span><i>canis et tuba vitiorum</i>.
But, as he misliked those sharpe biters, soe must he needes speake against
such preachers as flatter greate men, and sowe cushions under their
elbowes. They are like Heliotropium, which turnes the flower with the
sunne, though a cloud be interposed, soe they follow greatnes though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
clouded with synn; like the riuer Jordan, turnes and windes euery
way; speake nothing but silken wordes; at last the[y] become <i>serui multitudinis</i>;
say anie thing to please the people.</p>

<p>Nineveh, as St. Augustine in his booke <i>De Civitate Dei</i>, signifieth not
the citie but the synns of the people; and soe the prophecy verryfied, for that
synn was destroyed by their repentaunce within 40 dayes. But he rather
inclined to expound it by way of an implyed condicion, that they should
be overthrowen vnles they repented; soe was that prophecy of Isah understoode
to Hezekiah, Isaiah xxxviii. "Thou shalt dy and not live."</p>

<p>God is slowe in punishing, yet <i>tarditas p&oelig;næ gravitate pensatur</i>.</p>

<p>Gratious and righteous is the Lord in sparing and punishing.</p>

<p>The synne of Nineveh was Idolatry.</p>

<h3><span class="sidehead">fo. 40.<br>
10 Oct. 1602.</span><span class="smcap">At Paules Crosse.</span></h3>

<p>Dr. Spenser<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> preached. He remembred in his prayer the Companie of
the Fishmongers, as his speciall benefactors while he lived in Oxford; his
text the 5 of Isay, v. 4.</p>

<p>We are soe blind and peruerse by nature, that wee are soe farre from the
sence of our owne imperfections and the terror of our synn, that either
not seing or not acknowledging our owne weaknesses, wee runne headlong
into all wickednes, and hate soe much to be reformed, that God is
fayne to deale pollitikely with vs, propounding our state vnto vs in
parables, as it were an others case, that thereby drawing man from conceit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
of himselfe, which would make him partiall, he might draw an uncorrupt
iudgment of him self from him selfe. Soe dealt the Lord with David by
the parable of the poore mans sheepe, and soe here he taketh up a comparison
of the vine, to shewe Israell their ingratitude.</p>

<p>Parables are proportionable resemblances of things not well understoode;
they be vayles indeed, which couer things, but being remoued give a kinde
of light to them which before was insensible, and makes them seeme as
though they were sensible.</p>

<p>The things considerable in the text are, first, The churche, resembled by
the vine. 2. Gods benefits towards the Churche expressed in the manner
of his dressing the vine. 3. The fruit expected, grapes, iudgment and
righteousnes. 4. The fayling and ingratitude, by bringing forth sower
and wylde grapes; oppression and crying. 5. God's judgment, vers. 6.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 40<sup>b</sup>.</div>

<p>In the Church he considered, what it is, and where it is.</p>

<p>The Churche is compared most aptly to the vyne, for neither of them
spring naturally. <i>Non sumus de carne, nec voluntate hominis, sed bene-placito
Dei.</i> 2. Both spring, and growe, first in weakenes, yet then
they claspe their little hands and take hold on of an other, and soe going
on <i>crescunt sine modo</i>, the increase without measure, as Pliny sayth. 3.
Noe plant more flourishing in the summer, none more poore and bare<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
in winter. All followe the Church in prosperitie, and the rich, the
mighty, the wise, in persequution fall away like leaves. 4. Bring forth
fruit in clusters, which cheres the hart. God and men and angels reioyce
when the Church aboundes in workes of righteousnes and true holines.
5. Both have but one roote, though manie branches; Christ is the true
foundacion, other then this can no man lay. 6. The branches are ingrafted,
and as in planting all are tyed alike with the outward bond, yet all
proue not alike, soe all haue the same profession and outward meanes, yet
all growe not nor fructifie alike: but it is the inward grace that maketh the
true branche; as he is a Jewe that is one within. Rom. ii. 28, 29.</p>



<p>2. The Lord's vineyard is not to be knowne by the fruit (for we reade
here that it bringeth forth wyld grapes), but where the roote is <span class="sidenote">fo. 41.</span>planted,
where Christ is professed, there the Church is; it is nowe universall, not
yed to anie place; we reade of 7 Churches in the Reuelacions, though all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
not alike pure, yet all churches: Israell is his eldest sonne, though a
prodigall: as betwixt man and woman after a publique contract celebrated,
though the woman play the harlot and bring forth children of fornicacion
unto hir husband, yet continues shee his wife whose name shee beares
vntill a publique divorce be sued. Some churches are soare, some sicke,
some soe leprous that noe communion ought to [be] continued with them,
yet churches still. Yf anie aske, as manie papists use to doe, where our
church was before Martin Luther was borne, we aunswer that it is the
same churche that was from the beginninge, and noe newe on as they
terme it, for the weeding of a vyneyard is noe destroyinge, nor the
pruning any planting; for we have remoued but idolatrie and a privat masse
of ceremonies, which with the burying the author[?] of life in a hidden
and unknowne language had almost put the heavenly light out of our
candlesticke; and when the trashe of humaine inventions had raysed
themselues to soe high esteeme, it was tyme to say, "Yf Ephraim play
the harlot, yet lett not Israell synn."</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 41<sup>b</sup>.</div>

<p>Jerusalem litterally is the mother Churche of all.</p>

<p>The Churche, like the vine that hath many branches but one roote, may
haue severall members, but all knit together with the vnity of three bonds&mdash;one
Lord, one fayth, one baptisme. But nowe Rome, usurping over his
fellowes, speakes like Babilon in the 18 Reuel. "I cannot erre," and have
encroched an article vpon the Creede, that must be beeleeved upon payne
of damnation, that there is one visible heade of the Churche (which must
be the Pope). And yet in an &oelig;cumenical Counsell of 330 Catholike
Bishops it was decreed that Constantinople should have equall authority
with Rome; which plainely confuted their usurped universall supremacy.
Yet the Popes, by the assistaunce of the Emperours, haue, like ivy, risen
higher then the oke by which it climed: soe much that our countriman
Stapleton doubts not to call his Holines <i>Supremum in terris numen</i>.</p>

<p>3. The benefites and manner of dressing the vine: Genesis is but the
nurse of it; Exodus, the removing; Leviticus, the ordering and manner
of keeping it; Josua, the weeding, &amp;c. God soe loued it that he gave his
onely Sonne to redeeme it, and when he gave him, what gave he not with
him?</p>

<p>Might not the Church use the wordes of the leeper in the Ghospell:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane;" and why then complaynest
thou?</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 42.</div>

<p>True it is, yf we consider his power: for he that is able to rayse vp
children to Abraham of stones, to make the iron sweate, &amp;c. can purifie
our corruptions yf wee regard his power, and that without our meanes;
but God hath tyed himself to ordinary meanes, by his eternall decree:
and he that will not heare Moses and the prophets neither will he beleeve
though one should rise from the dead. Many were foule with the leprosie
in Nathans [Elishas?] tyme, yet none cured but Naman.</p>

<p>4. The fruit. All things, euen the meanest, imitate the Creator in doing
something in their kind for the common good, not themselves alone; the
olive doth not anoint itself with its owne oyle; the trees and plants which
spend themselues in bringing forth some fruit or berry holds it noe
longer then till it be ripe, and then letts it fall at his masters feete; the
grape is not made drunke with its owne iuyce.</p>

<p>"He that receiveth a benefit hath lost his liberty," saith Seneca; and,
since we have received such benefits of God as we can not, we would not
renounce, lett us glorifie him in our bodies whose we are, not our owne.</p>

<p>Aeternitie cometh before we worke, therefore our workes merit not
eternall life: and infants incorporat into the mysticall vyne are saued
though they dy before they are able to bring forth anie good worke.</p>

<p>Our good workes growe as it were in a cold region; the best of them,
even our prayers, scarce come to perfection throughe the imperfection of
our nature.</p>

<p>Good workes to be performed for mutuall helpe, and though we holde
ourselves sufficient, yet they are to be done, even as every thing <span class="sidenote">fo. 42<sup>b</sup>.</span>bringeth
forth something yf for noe other purpose yet to continue in its owne
state; like the spring, which, because it yeildeth water, is therefore continually
fed with water.</p>

<p><i>Bona opera sunt via regni, non causa regnandi. (Bernard.)</i></p>

<p>The fruits brought forth; wyld grapes: an heavy sight to a carefull
husbandman, to haue noe better reward of his paynes.</p>

<p>I pray God the Church of England may not justifie the synns of Sodome
and Judas. Couetousnes, the roote of all wickednes, maketh men
desyre to be greate rather then good, and this desyre causes them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
sucke even the lyfe from one another. There is a synn amongst us which
hath not bin heard of amongst the Gentiles, that wee should robb God,
and that is in tithing. Howe manie desyrous that the labouring man,
the minister, might be put out, that themselues might haue the inheritaunce.
It is the corruption of the ministery that all the dores of entraunce
are shut up but the dore of symony, soe that the most and best
places are for the most possessed by the worst; and, yf anie of the better
be forced to come in, they are constrayned to make shipwracke of a good
conscience.</p>



<p>If it be true which is published in the names of the popish faction, the
Pope hath sent a dispensation that the popish patrons may sell their presentations,
soe be it the money come to the maintenance of the Jesuites.
And will Peters successor thinke it lawefull to sell the guifts of the Holie
Ghost? Will Simon Peter become Simon Magus? But he will nowe become
a fisher for men; because he findes in their mouthes greater peices
then <span class="sidenote">fo. 43.</span>twenty pence. The ministers are like the hart and liver, from whence
are derived lyfe and nourishment by sound doctrine and good example into
the members of the Church, and yf these be corrupt it is much to be
feared the whole body is like to languishe in a dangerous consumption.</p>

<p>In defrauding the ministery, we pull downe the pillers of the house wee
dwell in.</p>

some tedious semblance of a long discourse, but the matter shortly cutt itself
into two parts, example and rule; one particular, the other generall; the
one experiment, the other science; the one of more force to proue, the other
to instruct. The argument is not <i>a posse ad esse</i>, but <i>ab esse ad posse</i>;
it hath bin, and therefore may be; nay by this place it shalbe, for <i>lege
mortali quod vnquam fuit, et hodie fieri potest</i>; but <i>lege æterna</i>, that which
hath bin shalbe agayne. Here is an acted performaunce, a demonstracion,
&#964;&#959; &#8001;&#964;&#953;, which are most forceable to persuade, being of all thinges sauing the
thinges themselves neerest our apprehension, leading from the sense to the
vnderstanding, which is our certaynest meane of acquiring knowledge,
since philosophie teacheth <i>quod nihil est intellectu, quod non prius fuit in

strongest motives to imitation. Rules are but sleeping and seeming admonitions.

<p>The examples are bipartite: each containing contrary doctrines, like
the language of them in the last chapter of Nehemias, half Jewishe, half
Ashdoch; like the bands of the Levites, that parted themselves one companie
to one mount to blesse, the other to an other to curse, the people; soe
the one part denounceth judgment, the other declareth mercy: they may
be compared to the cleane beastes, Deut. xiv., which had parted hoofes,
and chewed the cudd; soe here on the one syde is the old world drowned,
on the other Noach saved; on the one Sodom burned, on the other Lott
preserved. They are three of the strangest and fearefullest examples in
nature; the fall of the Angells, the drowning of the world, the burning of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
Sodome; they stretch from one end to an other, alpha and omega,
heaven and earth, men and angels, the most excellent payre of God's
creatures, and the deluge &oelig;cumenicall and universall. But God in his
punishment, like a wise prince, will begin at his owne sanctuary, at his
owne house, <i>non habitabit mecum iniquus</i>,
I will not suffer a wicked person
to dwell in my house, and therefore first turned the angels from his habitacion.
Angels in their creacion, <i>vere</i> &#948;&#949;&#8017;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;, the second light, the eyes
and eares of the great king, continuall attendantes in his court and assistauntes
of his throne; they are farr above the greatest saint, for wee
shalbe but like them, and they are next to the Sonne of God, otherwise
he had said nothing when he said, to which of the angells sayd he at anie
tyme, &amp;c. <i>Heb.</i>: they were <span class="sidenote">fo. 47<sup>b</sup>.<br>
Oct. 1602.</span><i>in summo non in tuto</i>, or rather <i>non in summo
sed in tuto</i>, untill they synned. But what their synne was, I may safely
say I knowe not. One sayth <i>non seruarunt principatum</i>, and St. Jo.
sayth, <i>non steterunt in veritate</i>, their synn was treason, [they] continued
not in their allegeaunce and fidelity; an other, <i>et in angelis vacuitatem,
prauitatem, infamiam reperiit</i>; an other, though an absurd opinion, that
it was fleshly lust, and concupiscence, by carnall copulacion with women
upon earth, and this they would lay upon these wordes, and the Sonnes of
God tooke the daughters of men; but of this it was sayd, <i>perquam
noxium audire et credere</i>. And yet it became as common as it was
absurd, because men thereby thought they might sooth themselves in that
synn, and thinke it tollerable when angells had done the like before them.</p>

<p>An other opinion more probable, that it was noe carnall, but spirituall
luxury that overthrewe them, a kinde of selfe love, when they overvalued
their owne excellency, and forgat their Creator; and this opinion that
their synn was pride is the most receiued and most like, because after his
fall the first temptation that he made was of pride to Adam in paradise,
<i>enim similis altissimo</i>.</p>

<p>The Diuel neuer desyred to be like God in his essence, for that being
impossible he could never conceiue it, and that is neuer in appeticion
which was not first in apprehension. Yet he may be sayd to affect it
<i>desyderio complacentiæ, non efficaciæ</i>, because he might please himself with
such conceits, not conceaue howe he might attaine to those pleasures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to this purpose some there be that write as though they had been taken
up into the third heaven, and heard and seene the conflict betwixt Michael
and the diuel: and will not stick to affirme that Michael had his name
because when the diuel like a great giant bellowed out blasphemie against
the most highest, denying that he had any creator or superior, Michael
should resist and tell him, <i>Quis ut Deus</i>, which is the interpretacion of
Michael; soe though it be incertaine what was the synn of angells, yet
is it most certayne that they fell from the highest happines to the lowest
wretchednes; the fall was like lightning suddein, and the place of it not
possible to be found; it passeth the capacitie of man to expresse it by
comparison soe perfectly that he may say <i>hoc impetu</i>; and for their payne
it is <i>transcendens, et transcendentia transcendit</i>, it is invaluable, incomprehensible,
passeth all hyperbole; there was a present amission of place,
grace, glory, the fruition of Godes presence, &amp;c. which is the greatest of
<span class="sidenote">fo. 48<sup>b</sup>.<br>

future miseries, <i>et Nihil magis adversarium quam expectatio; et Quo me
vindicta reservas?</i></p>

<p>It was the opinion of Origen long since condemned for erronius, that
the diuels might be saued, and his reason was because they had <i>liberum
voluntatis arbitrium</i>, which might perhaps change and encline to the desyre
of good, and soe through repentaunce obteyne mercy; but the diuels
are soe obdurate in their malice that though they may have <i>stimulum conscienciæ</i>,
yet they can neuer come <i>ad correptionem gratiæ</i>, and in that
opinion Origen is said &#928;&#955;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957; non &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;. Another prop to
his opinion was Jacobs ladder, where he imagined the descending and
ascending of angels could meane nothing but the fall and restitution of
angels.</p>


<p>The second example is the drowning of the world, a descent from
heaven to earth in judgments. The world is termed &#954;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#987; of the Grecians,
from the excellent beauty thereof, and of the Lattynes <i>mundus,
quia nihil mundius</i>, but here it is used to expresse the universalitie of the
destruction, as the hystorie declares it Gen. vi. 7, etc. vii. 21, 22, 23, 24:
God destroyed euery thing that was vpon the earth from man to beast,
to the creeping thing, and to the foule of the heaven, onely the fishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
escaped, and the reason one rendreth was because the sea onely was undefiled
at that tyme; there was then noe sayling upon that element, noe
pyracie and murder committed upon it, noe forrein invasion intended over
it, noe trafficque with the nations for straunge comodities, nor for one an
others synnes and vices; all the other creatures were polluted by man, and
were [to] be purged with <a name="tn_png_092"></a><!--TN: Space added between "that" and "floud"-->that floud. The ayre as farr as our eyes could looke
and fascinate, even the foules as far as our breath could move, were infected
with the contagion thereof; all were uncleane, all were to be
clensed or punished. <span class="sidenote">fo. 49.<br>

The greatnes of their number cannot excuse, but
aggrauates the offence. A multitude may synn and their synn is more
grievous, <i>qui cum multitudine peccat, cum multitudine periet</i>; and for the
most part, the most are the worst. It is noe sound argument, it is well
done because many doe so. The fox brings forth many cubbes, and the
lyon hath but one whelpe at once, yet that is a lyon, and more then manie
foxes. The harlot boasts that shee had manie moe resorted to hir house
then Socrates to his schole, but hir followers went the way of darknes.</p>


<p>"And brought in the floud:" and therefor a miracle supernatural
wrought by the finger of God, not as some imagine by the conjunction of
waterishe planets, soe atributinge all to and confirming all by naturall
meanes, they say the world shalbe destroyed by fire, as it was by water,
when there shall happen the like conjunction of firy, as there was of
watery planets; but beleeve God, whoe sayth <i>Ego pluam</i>. And this was
against nature to destroy hir owne workes. The length of the rayne, forty
dayes, the continuaunce of the waters for twelve monethes, the dissolucion
of soe muche ayre with water as should make a generall deluge. These
are directly against the rules of naturall philosophie, besydes the influence
of a planet never stretcheth beyond his hemisphere, all which shewe
plainely, that it was the miraculous worke of God, not effected by the
course of nature. This was not <i>imber in furore missus</i>, to destroy or
famishe some particular city or country, of which kinde of baptismes our
land hath within fewe yeares felt many, but this made the sea, which before
made but one spheare with the earth, as man and wife make but one
flesh, breake the boundes of modesty and overflowe the whole; that which
before was the girdle of the earth, nowe girt it, but in such a fashion,
that it stiffled all. It was such a dropsie in the world, that our simples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>

scores with our best helpes of art or nature.</p>

<p>But it may be said, What, will God punishe the goode with the wicked?
Will he drownd, all together, the righteous and the bad? Will he say
<i>Pereant amici, modo pereant inimici</i>? Will he command <i>stragem tam
amicorum quam hostium</i>? Shall his judgments be like the nett in the
Gospell, that catcheth good and bad togither? Noe, for he punished the
old world. This floud was his sope and nitar to scoure of the filth, to
seuer the good from the euill, the wheat from the chaffe. He brought
the floud upon the ungodly, but he "saued Noah, the eighth person;" a
small number, a child may tell them, a poore number, <i>pauperi est numerare</i>,
but eight persons saved. Those tymes were evil, but there are worse
dayes not instant but extant, wherein iniquitie prescribes hypocrisie, settes
hir hand to manie false bills, settes downe one hundred for ten, the whole
is overflowne with all wickednes, &amp;c. The second part is God's mercy,
but he "saued Noah" like a ring on his finger, he kept him as writing in
the palme of his hand, as the apple of his eye, and as a seale on his heart.
He built him a castle stronger then brasse, and lockt him up in the arke
like a jewell in casket. He preserved him safe in a wodden vessell
amongst the toppes of mountains, in a world of waters, without card,
tacleing, or pilot. He was saued between judgment and judgment, like
Susanna betwixt the twoe elders, like the Children of Israell betweene two
walles of water in the Red Sea, like Christ betweene the two theiues; soe
that it may be truly sayd, it was noe meaner a miracle in sauing Noah,
then in drowning the whole world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 50.<br>

<p>But "saued Noah, the eight person, a preacher of righteousnes." Here
is a banner of hope to all that feare God. When Justice was running hir
course like a strong giant to haue destroyed the whole world, Mercy mett,
encountered, and told hir that she must not touch Gods anoynted, nor doe
his prophetes anie harme. There was Noah, "a preacher of righteousnes,"
and he must be spared, he was a preacher, not a whisperer in corners,
singing to himselfe and his muses. This Noah was the hemme of the
world, the remnant of the old, and the element of the newe: he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<i>communis terminus</i>, the first shipwright, and yet "a preacher of righteousnes."
Nowe concerninge the estimacion of preachers in auncient
tymes, and the contempt of that calling in these dayes, their high account
with God, and their neglect with men, from hence he said he could
paradox manie conclusions which tyme forced him to ouer slip. But in
this age lett a preacher be as aunciently discended and of as good a parentage,
bee as well qualified, as soundly learned, of as comely personage,
as sweete a conversation, have a mother witt, and perhaps a
fathers blessing to, lett him be equall in all the giftes and ornamentes of
nature, art, and fortune to a man of an other profession, yet he shall be
scorned, derided, and pointed at like a bird of diuers strange colours, and
all because he beares the name of a preacher.</p>

<p>Tymes past were so liberall to the clergy that for feare all would have
runne into their handes there were statutes of mortmaine enacted to restrayne
that current: but devotion at this day is grown soe cold, that the
harts and hands of all are a verry mortmaine it self; they hold soe fast
they will part from nothing; noe, not from that which hath bin of auncient
given to holie uses. There are in England aboue 3000 impropriacions,
where the minister hath a poore stipend; their bread is broken
amongst strangers, the foxes and their cubbes liue in their ruines, the
swallowe builds hir nest and the satyres daunce and revill where the
Leuites were wont to sing, the Church liuings are seised vpon and possessed
by the secular; it was the old lawe, that none should eate the bread
of the aultar but those that wayted at the altar, those things which were
provided for the pastors of our soules, with what conscience can they
receive, which are not able to feede them. <i>O miseram sponsam talibus

<p>It is strange that that abhominable synn of Symony should be so common,

diligently, I will pray for you deuoutly, but that <i>quid dabitis</i> liveth still
with those of Judas his humor. They thinke all to much for the preacher,
nothing to much for themselves; it must be enacted that they may not
haue to much for feare of surfetting; they would haue them, according to

<p>"A preacher of righteousnes" or a righteous preacher, such a one
as Jo. Baptist was; he preached, as all ought to doe, by his lyfe, by his
hands. By his lyfe; <i>vel non omnino vel moribus doceto</i>. He preached
amendement from synn, he preached the lawes of nature and the judgments
imminent, and as some thinke he preached Christ alsoe. And
wee preache the lawe of nature: doth not nature teache you, &amp;c. Wee
preache faythe: then being justified by faythe. Wee preache the lawe of

righteousnes, <i>semen et germen</i>, embued, endued, active, and contemplative,
justificacion and sanctificacion, primitiue and imputed, the one in Christ
absolute, the other in us. Righteousnes acted by Christ and accepted by
us, which is the true justifying righteousnes, and aboue all the others.</p>

<p>"And deliuered just Lott." The word signified a kinde of force, as

amongst the wicked, and was not infected with them; <i>bonum esse cum

vixisse, eximium</i>. Soe was Abraham in Chaldea, Moses in the
Court of Pharao, and yet noe partakers of the synnes of those places,
"vexed with the uncleane conversacion." <i>Non veniat anima mea in consilium

When Martiall asked Nazianzeene but a question, Nazianzeene told him
he would not answere <i>nisi purgatus fuerit</i>. Wee must not say soe much

synn of Sodome. Wee will dissemble with the hyppocrite, temporise with

saying that his owne performances were speaking wittnesses for him,

former is, nowe in this time of plenty to make prouision of corne to
fill the magazines of the Citie, as well for suddein occasions as for
prouision for the poore in tyme of dearth: this he aduised the maior
to have speciall care of, and to amend their neglect by diligence,
while their fault sleepes in the bosome of hir Majesties clemency.

foreseeing the perilous consequence yf he should breake out, sent for
the otheres patent, as desyrous to peruse the forme of the graunt,

cancelled both the patent and the whole record, to preuent the
rebellion like to ensue upon the graunt. A strange president.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">fo. 67.<br>
21 Nov. 1602.</span><span class="smcap">Mr. Fenton</span>, reader of Gray's Inn. His text, Luke xix. 9, "This day
is salvacion come unto this house: insoemuch as this man also is become
the sonne of Abraham." This is an absolution, and a rule of it, 1. He
that pronounceth the absolution is Christ; 2. The person absolued is
Zachee. An example that may most move this auditorie to followe
Christ; since this man was rich and a ruler of the people, whereas the
most of them that followed Christ had nothing to loose; 3. The ground
of his absolucion, that he was the sonne of Abraham, which he proved to
Christ by his fayth, to the world by his works. He observed 5 parts:
1. The nature of the absolution, that it is a declaracion of saluacion. 2.
By whom it is declared, viz. by Christ. 3. How far it extended, to Zachee
and his family. 4. Upon what ground, that is, his fayth and repentaunce.
5. Howe soone, "This day."</p>

<p>Saluacion is come; wee are not able to seeke it; therefore Christ sayd,
"Enter into thy fathers joy;" for wee are not capable that it should
enter into us; but enter into that joy as the bucket into the fountayne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Yf he should endeauour to prefix a preface for attention, he could not
finde a better then to tell them he must tell them of saluation. None
under the degree of an angell was thought worthie to publishe the first
tydinges of it to a fewe shepheards.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 67<sup>b</sup>.<br>
21 Nov. 1602.</div>

<p>Noe preacher able to giue his auditorie a tast of saluacion. It is one
thing to forgive, another thing to declare forgivenes of synnes; the former
is personall, and that Christ carried to heaven with him, the other
ministeriall, and that he left behinde to his disciples and apostles;
"Whose synnes you binde shallbe bound, whose synnes you remitt shalbe
loosed."</p>


<p>The raysing of Lazarus, a resemblaunce of absolucion. Lazarus had
layen three dayes when Christ came to rayse him; he bad him come out;
here is his voyce, which being seconded by divine power restored him to
lyfe; soe the word of God preached to a synner, being seconded with
divine grace, rayseth the synner.</p>


<p>Popishe priests and Jesuites play fast and loose with mens consciences.</p>


<p>Jesuites come into riche mens houses, not to bring them salvacion,
but because there is something to be fisht for. Jesus and the Church
wee knowe; but whoe are these? Soe they are sent away naked and
torne, like those presumptuous fellowes that would have cast out diuels
in Christs name without his leaue, and the God of heaven will laugh
them to scorne.</p>



<p>Not all poore blessed, but the poore in spirit onely; nor all rich cursed,
but the riche in this world onely; for here is Zache blessed. Howsoever
Christs words import a greate difficulty for rich men to enter into
heauen, when, after he had compared heauen gate to a needles eye, and
the rich man to a cammel, hee aunswered his disciples words, that all
things are possible with God, and as though it were a miracle with men.
Hardly can he runne after Christ when his hart is lockt vp in his coffer.
<span class="sidenote">fo. 68.<br>
21 Nov. 1602.</span>But the scripture tells us there is a rich Abraham in heaven, as well as a
Dives in hell. Yf anie have inriched themselves by forged cauillacion
lett them not despayre, for soe did Zache. Yf anie have a place that he
must have vnder him as many officers as Briareus had hands, through
whose hands many things may be ill carried, lett him not be discouraged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
for soe had Zache. Yf anie be branded with infamie lett him yet be
comforted by the example of Zache, for soe was hee, and yet became a
true Christian.</p>

<p>Saluacion came unto Zache by a threefold conveyaunce: 1. By his
riches, which to the good are sacramentes of His favor. 2. That himself
being conuert, his whole family was soe; the servants and attendants
are the shaddowes of their master; they moue at his motion. 3. That
all his househould was blessed for his sake; such are the braunches as
the roote; the whole lumpe was made holie by the first fruits.</p>

<p>Thrice happie land, whose prince is the daughter of Abraham, crowning
it with the sacraments of temporall blessings. Add, O Lord! this
blessing, that hir dayes may be multiplied as the starres of heaven.</p>



<p>To become the sonne of Abraham is to receive the image of Abraham.
He hath two images, his fayth, and his workes. Imitate him: 1. In
rejoycing in God, as Simeon did when he had Christ in his armes, and
this joy made the burden seeme light to the lame man when he carried
his bed, after Christ had cured him. <span class="sidenote">fo. 68<sup>b</sup>.<br>
21. Nov. 1602.</span>2. In hospitallitie he received
angels, and amongst them God, for one was called Jehoua. 3. In despising
to growe rich by ill meanes. Sodome could not make him rich,
because he would not have it said that the diuel had made him riche.</p>

<p>There is none but would spend the best bloud in his body, and stretch
his verry hart strings, to be made sure of his salvacion; but the matter is
easier, you must stretch your purse-strings, and restore what you have
gotten wrongefully, otherwise noe security of saluacion.</p>

<p>A peremptory to conclude before his premisses.</p>



<p>What motives to restitution. Should I propound the rigor of the
lawe, you will say that is taken away by the gospell. Should I sett
before you the commendable examples of such as professed restitution,
you will alledge your owne imperfection&mdash;they were perfect and rare
men, wee must not look for such perfection. Shall I tell you there
are but four crying synnes, and this is one of them&mdash;"The syn of
them that have taken from others by fraud or violence cryeth before
the Lord of Hosts," as though nothing could appease but vengeance.
Yet, you will say, though the syn be heynous, yet the mercy of God
is over all his workes, and there is more virtue in the seede of the
woman to heale then there can be poison in the serpent to hurt us. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
God forgiueth all upon repentaunce. 'Tis true God absolueth the penitent,
but upon condicion that he restore the pledge that he withheld, and that
which he hath robbed. But may not this be dispensed withall by the
<span class="sidenote">fo. 69.<br>
21 Nov. 1602.</span>gospell? The shaddowe points at the truthe. In the v. of Numbers, 7 [v.]
besides the ransom for the attonement, the goods that were deteyned
must be restored. Christ resembleth the ram, &amp;c. <i>Ob.</i> Hath not Christ
paid all our debts for us? Yes, but such as thou couldst not pay
thyselfe; he hath satisfied God for thy syn, and thou must satisfie thy
brother for the wrong thou hast done him yf thou beest able, otherwise
thou must look for noe absolucion, for without repentaunce and amendment
noe absolucion, and without restitution no true repentaunce. It
may be you will say you are sorry for that you have gayned wrongfully,
and meane to doe soe noe more. This is noe true sorrowe nor sufficient
repentaunce, for soe long as you reteine the thing, there is a continuaunce
of the syn, for thou holdest that willingly which was gotten wrongfully.
Surely yf a theife had taken your purse, and should tell you he were
sorry, but could not finde in his heart to give you it againe, you would
thinke he did but mocke you. But be not deceived, God will not be
mocked. Glaunces make noe impression. There is a worldly sorrowe,
and there is a godly sorrowe. Soe long as the goods are retained <i>p&oelig;itentia
non agitur sed fingitur</i>. But <i>pænitentia vera non est pænitenda</i>.
But you will say, yf I should make restitution I should empty manie of
my bags, and make a greate hole in my lands, and this would make me
sorry againe; but this is worldly. Soe there would followe a certaine
kinde of shame upon restitucion; but the point is to resolve first to
restore, and then doubt not but the wisdome of God will cause you to
restore without shame, as the cunning of the diuel made you gett
without shame.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 69.<br>
21 Nov. 1602.</div>

<p>This day. When God came to reprehend and denounce judgment against
Adam in Paradise, it is sayd he walked; but when he comes with saluacion
he comes with hindes feet swiftly. This day. Against procrastinacion
and deferring repentaunce. It is a fearefull saying, they shall striue to
enter in and cannot, because they came not soone enough; too many
think they have the Spirit of God in a string, and are able to dispatch all
while the bell is tolling. But God sayth, they shall cry, but I will not
hear them; then they shall seeke me earely, but they shall not finde me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
because they cry and seeke too late. The example of the theife on the
crosse is noe example. It was a miracle, that Christ might shewe the
power of his diuinity in his greatest humiliacion: besides, the theife
had moe and greater graces then manie of the disciples at that time,
for some had forsaken and none durst confesse him. And besydes, he
were but a desperat theife that would presume because the prince had
graunted one pardon.</p>

<p>Outward actions of Christ point at inward and spirituall matters; the
raysing of Lazarus that had bin dead three dayes was with great
difficulty. Christ was fayne to cry out and grone ere he could get him up.
And the disciples could not cast out the diuel that had possessed the man
from his infancy. And when Christ cast him out it was with wonderfull
tormentinges to the possessed; soe dangerous delay, for the difficulty to
repent, syn growing as deare as old, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Tolson</span> of Queenes Colledge in Cambridge; his text in Ephes. v.
25: "As Christ alsoe hath loved the Church, and hath given himself for
hir, that he might sanctifie it."</p>

<p>The blessinges of God to man are infinit and exceeding gracious; many
being giuen which we knowe not of, many before wee aske them, manie
which wee are unthankefull for; but of all this gift is most admirable,
most inestimable, Christ gave himselfe.</p>

<p>He considered the person giving, the party receiving.</p>

<p>There is noe creature soe base and little but if it be considered with reason
it may shewe, as were written in greate caractars, that there is a God.</p>

<p>God is infinit and eternall, therefore can be but one in essence. One
person doth not differ from another really in the essence of deity. Yet
each person differeth really from other, and haue their proper personall
operacions not common to all. Soe here Christ is said to have giuen
himselfe, that is, the person of the sonne of God, perfect God and perfect
man; he gave not his body, nor his soule, nor his whole humanitie onely,&mdash;for
if all the creatures in the world were heaped up togither to be giuen,
they were noe sufficient sacrifice to satisffie the justice of God,&mdash;but he
gave himselfe, his whole person.</p>

<p>But two deaths of the soule, synn and eternall damnacion; to affirme
that the soule of Christ suffered either were horrible blasphemie.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 71<sup>b</sup>.<br>
28 Nov. 1602.</div>

<p>Wee must soe worship God as a trinity in vnity, and an vnity in
trynity, otherwise we worship but our owne fastasie.</p>

<p>Christ was <i>et sacerdos et sacrificium</i>, he gave himselfe.</p>

<p><i>Christus totus mortuus est, non totum Christi</i>, the whole person of Christ
and both his natures suffered; his deity and soule being mortall could not,
but his whole person, wherein both natures are indissolubly united.
<i>Christus homo in terra, deus in c&oelig;lo, Christus in utroque.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ not made in nor by the Virgin, but of the Virgin; therefore perfect
man, not an essence of a nature above the angels but inferior to
the Godhead: but the splendor or brightnes of Gods glory, the engraven
forme of his person, (Hebr. i. cap.) therefore perfect God.</p>

<p>He gave himselfe not for all men, but for his Church; he died for all
<i>sufficienter non efficienter</i>; he would have all men saued, <i>revelata non occulta
voluntate</i>, or rather, as a Father sayth, <i>Deus vult omnes salvos fieri, non quod
nullus hominum sit quem non velit salvum fieri, sed quia nemo salvus fit
nisi quem velit</i>; he saveth whom he pleaseth, and they are saved because
he will.</p>

<p>Christ gave himselfe for the Church, and hence growes the greate
quarrell betwixt Papists and us Protestants, for, this gift being soe precious
that none can be saved without it, every one is ready to intitle himselfe
thereunto, and challeng his part therin; noe heretike so damnable, but
would hold he was of the Churche, but the point is whether they bee what
they pretend, or haue what they arrogate. And here, because, as he said,
the text gaue him occasion, and he had direction from the superuisor of
this sea, he spake some thinge against the common enimye.</p>

<p><i>Ecclesia dicitur &#945;&#960;&#959; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#949;&#954;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#957;, ab evocando</i>, because it is a people
called from the rest to be sanctified by Christ.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 72.<br>
28 Nov. 1602.</div>

<p>The Church is compared unto the moone for fayrenes and to the sonne
for brightnes, therefore the church is not a companie of reprobates, and
idolatrous hereticks, as Rome is. Christ is not the head of such a body.
Those which give him such a body doe, as the poet sayth, <i>humano capiti
cervicem adjungere equinam</i>, but if they define the Church such a congregacion,
the[y] may easily mainteane theirs to be one.</p>

<p>The Papists have a trick of appropriatinge the name of the Church to
themselves onely; as they reade the Church, it is theirs dead sure; but this
is but the fashion of Cresilaus of Athens, a franticke fellowe, that would
board all ships that arrived, searche and take account of all things as they
were his owne, when poore fellowe he was scarse worth the clothes on
his backe.</p>

<p>The Papists call their masse a bloudles sacrifice, but yf wee look backe
but [to] the late tymes before hir Majesties happie entraunce, wee may see
tokens and wittnes enough, that it is the most bloudy kind that ever was
invented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Christ gave himselfe: noe virtue that is not voluntary: he gave himselfe
willingly, soe saith he, "I lay downe my life, and noe man taketh it
from me," though the Jewes layd violent hands upon him, which made
them inexcusable; yet because yf he would have resisted, they could not
have effected their malice, therefore his subjection to their violence was
voluntary.</p>

<p>Nowe from informing your understandings, give me leave, said he, to
proceede to the reforming your wills and affections.</p>

<p>Vses. Since Christ hath giuen himselfe for vs, such worthles creatures,
such nothings indeed, let us dedicate our soules, ourselves, our thoughts,
and actions to his service for a reasonable sacrifice. Christ gaue his whole
person for vs, wee must give our whole selues to him; not as some which
are content to be present at his seruice, but haue their myndes about
other matters; or as others which will say they haue given their mynds
to God, and serue him in their soule, though their bodies be present
where he is most dishonored, as the yong degenerat trauayler that can be
content, be present, and perhaps partaker at a masse, and yet thinke he
can be sound at the hart for all that. But wee must apply both body
and soule to Christs seruice. Most trauaylers returne, either worse men
or worse subjects; caveat in permitting to many trauailers. Some can be
content to be feruent and zealous in the halcion dayes of the gospell, as
Peter, but lett the sword, persecution, be once drawne out the[y] strait
withdrawe them selves and leaue their maister. Yf the[y] think they spie a
tempest but comming a farr of, strait they runn under hatches. Yf Judas
come with a kisse, and a companie with swordes and staues, they are
gone. All were hott and zealous against the Papist in the beginning of
hir Majesties raigne; all cold, as it were asleepe, nay dead, in these tymes.</p>

<p>Some slaunder the Court as though they were neuters, some the
universities as yf inclining to Popery, many looking for a tolleracion; but
whither shall wee goe? here is the word of lyfe.</p>

<h3><span class="sidehead">fo. 73.<br>
5 Dec. 1602.</span><span class="smcap">Mr. Layfeild at St. Clements.</span></h3>

<p>His text, 2 Cor. iii. 7: "Whoe hath alsoe made us fitt ministers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Newe Testament, not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter
killeth, but the spirit quickeneth."</p>

<p>He had preached heretofore of this text, and had in that sermon obserued
out of this place that the duty of a Christian and a fitt minister
are severall and distinct. Nowe he considered the object whereabout the
office of a minister is imployed, which is the Newe Testament, and to
this purpose he shewed the difference betwixt the Old and Newe Testament,
the old lawe and the newe, which consisted not onely in this
(which the Papists make to all), that the newe is more plaine then the
old, and that Moses was the writer of the first and Christ of the latter;
but this the true essentiall difference, the old was a covenant; a mutuall
sponsion and stipulacion; a promise upon condicion; something to be
performed on either part. <i>Fac hoc</i>, sayth God to man, this is the lawe to
be observed by man, <i>et vives</i>, and I will give thee lyfe; trust me with
that. But the gospell, the Newe Testament, is a covenant absolute, like
that "I have made a covenant with myne eyes," and that "I have made
a covenant with David that I will not fayle:" a promise on Gods part
onely, like a testament in this, that it is a free donacion without condicion
precedent, all meerely of grace and favour from God. Noe merit from us.
When he assended he gave gifts unto men.</p>

<p>When man had entered into covenant with God, and by breaking of it
became soe farre his debtor that he had forfayted body and soule for his
synn, God dealt mercifully with him, and tooke a sacrifice of some living
beast as a bond which deferred, not satisfied, the debt, and this to continue
till Christs comming, whose death should be a discharge of that
obligacion, and the whole debt alsoe for soe manie as could obtaine
Christs favour.</p>




<p class="section"><span class="sidenote">fo. 73<sup>b</sup>.<br>
5 Dec. 1602.</span>In the afternoone, the same man at the same place. After a briefe
recapitulacion of what he had deliuered in the forenoone, he proceeded to
shewe the office of a minister of the Newe Testament, with the difference
betweene the preists of the Old and the ministers of the Newe Testament.
The office of those was to teache the covenant, to denounce the curse, and
to take sacrifices of synners as obligacions and testimonies against the
synner that he had soe often forfayted his soule and body; the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the minister of the New Testament is to preache both the lawe to deject
and humble the synner by the operacion of the spirit; and the gospell to
rayse and comfort him, that he may not despayre and dye, but beeleeve
and be saved; their office is alsoe as executors of Christs testament to
dispose of his legacyes, his promises; that is, to remitt synnes to every
penitent beleeving synner; and lastly, to impart and confirme the graces
by ministring his blessed sacraments.</p>

<p>The letter killeth, for that sayth in the lawe, Thou must doe this, thou
must not doe that, otherwise God must be satisfied; thou must be punished,
or els thou must have pardon. Man could not obserue them;
man was not able to abide the punishment&mdash;was like a man in prison,
could not gett forth to sue for pardon; was like a poor man deepely indebted,
had noe meanes to make satisfaction. The gospell likewise in the
letter sayth, Thou must repent, thou must beleeue, or els thou canst not
be saued; and yet none of them is in our power. But the spirit quickeneth;
that shewes vs Christ hath satisfied, and giues vs grace to beleeve it, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 74.<br>
5 Dec. 1602.</div>

<p>The lawe of the Old Testament is not abolished by the Newe, but the
old covenant, the condicion of the lawe, is taken awaye; for the lawe continues
and hath a singular vse in the ministry of the Newe Testament, to
make a synner knowe and confesse himselfe such a one, for before he
finde his synnes greuous he hath noe neede of a sauiour; as Christ sayd,
"I came not to call the righteous but synners to repentaunce," and "Come
vnto me, all ye that are weary, and I will easye you," and "The whole
neede not the physitian."</p>

<p>Yf the minister dispense Christs legacyes to a counterfayt and dissemblinge
penitent, yet they haue done their duty. And as Christ sayd to
his disciples, "When you enter into anie place, say peace be with you,
and yf the Sonne of peace be not there, your peace shall returne againe
vnto you."</p>

<p>Christ made his testament, bequeathed legacyes, made his executors
the disposers of them: therefore there must be certaine markes and notes,
as certaine as the names of persons to knowe the persons to whom the
legacyes are bequeathed, otherwise the executors cannot knowe howe [to]
dispose of them. And these markes are fayth and repentaunce, for to
euery one that repenteth and beleeueth remission of syn is giuen: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
therefore it followeth, against the doctrine of the Church of Rome, that a
man must beleeue, and knowe that he beleeueth, hath fayth and repentaunce,
for that generall fayth of that church in generall is noe more but
to beleeue noe [more?] but this, that all that is in the Scripture is true,
that all that beleeue shall be saued, and that noe man knoweth whether
he beleeue or repent. But, on the contrarie, we hold that beleeue and
fayth must be in particuler, and then such a person is become a legatary
certaine in Christs testament, and capable of the disposicion of the promise.</p>

are like a thred of skarlett." For the exposicion of this text he said he
would not doe as many would after the fancy of their owne braine, but
according to the Scripture, expound it by some other place, and that was
ii. of Josua, where he findeth the same words, a skarlet thred, v. 21,
"Shee bound the skarlet threed in the windowe." He told a long story
of Rahab before he came to the threed; and after almost all his sermon
was some allusion to that story. Rabby Shulamo makes this comparison,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
that the lips are said to be like a threed of skarlett, to signifie such person
in the churche whose promises are performaunces, whose wordes are
workes, as the red threed was a simbole and a signe unto Rahab. Rahab
was a tauernes, and it signifies alsoe an harlot, because such kinde of
<span class="sidenote">fo. 80<sup>b</sup>.<br>

scarlett; the colour sheweth life within, as palenes death.</p>

<p>Joshua a type of Jesus, and the wordes the same in seuerall languages.
Moses could not bring the children of Israel into the land of promise, but
that was the office of Joshua; the lawe could not be our saviour, but
Christ is he that must bring us to heaven. Joshua sent two spies; Christ
obserued the same number, and alwayes sent two disciples togither. 3.
What the spies undertooke and promised according to their commission
was firme and ratified by Joshua; whose synnes the disciples, and nowe
the ministers, according to their power, remitt or binde on earth, shalbe
remitted or bound in heaven.</p>

<p>There are enough of Rahab's profession in euery place; a man may
finde a greate many more then a good sorte. "I would not give a penny
for an 100 of them," said he.</p>

<p>Rahab beleeved and shewed it by hir workes. Every one will say he
beleeues, but except he can showe it to me by his workes, I will not give
two strawes for it; lett him carry it to the exchange and see what he can

<p>When God deliuered his people from the Aegiptians he led them with

In discourse howe obstinate some are, that they will not

Cranmer remembred this story. Not long since one Keyt a Kentishe
man had made [his] will, whereby he bequeathed a great legacy to
one Harris, but after, being displeased, he gave out that he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
revoke his will, and Harris should have nothing, whereupon Harris,
<span class="sidenote">fo. 83<sup>b</sup>.<br>

This poore knave having effected this villany began to grow resty,
could not endure to worke any more, but would be maynteyned by
Harris for this feate, otherwise most desperatly he threatened to
reveall the matter. Thus the fellowe fedd soe long, and spent soe
lavishly upon himselfe and his queanes, out of Harris's purse, that
Harris, growing weary of the charge, began to thinke howe he
might conceale the first by practising a second murther; which he
plotted in this manner, he would invite the knave to a dynner at
Maidstone, and procure some to murther him as he should come
through the woodes. But the fellowe, fearing the worst (because
they had bin at some hott words before) imparted his feare to his
whore whome he kept, told hir that yf he were murthered shee
should accuse the Harrisses, and wisht hir to looke in the bottome
of his deske, and there shee should finde that would be sufficient to
hang them. As he feared it happened, for he was murthered; the
queane brought all to light, and those papers in his deske shewed the
whole manner of the former murther of Keyt, whereupon the
Harrises were indited, found gilty, and adjudged to be hanged.
The former tooke it upon his death that he was guiltles of the latter

<p>One <span class="smcap">Barlowe</span>, a beardless man of Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.</p>

<p>After his prayer and before he came to his text, he made a large exordium
after this fashion; that yf Paule sayth of himselfe that he was
amongst the Corinthians in weaknes, in feare and trembling, much more
might he say the like of himselfe: whoe was weake in deliveraunce and
methode, &amp;c. Yet he entreated they would not heare, as some say they
will heare, the man, but that they would regard the matter. Of all parts of
Scripture the book of the Preacher may seeme most befitting a preacher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
wherein is lively depainted the vanity of the world and all things therein:
wherof at this time he intended to speake, but not out of the Preacher, but
out of the words of St. Paule, and those were written in the viiith chapter
to the Romans, the 19, 20, 21, and 22 verses. His distribution of this
text, or rather context as he called it, because he said it was like Christs
garment soe wouen togither that it might not be parted, was into five
points: 1. That the creature is subject to vanity, v. 20. 2d. The reason
of this subjection, by reason of him which hath subdued it vnder hope.
3. That the creatures shall be delivered, and hope for deliveraunce. 4. The
effects of the subjection to vanity: every creature groneth with us, v. 22.
5. The effect of hope, the feruent desyre of the creature wayteth, &amp;c. v. 19.
He said this place of Scripture is accounted the hardest in all Paules
Epistles. For the first, that the creature is subject to vanity, he interpreted
the word by "creature" is ment, in this place, the heavens, the
<span class="sidenote">fo. 86<sup>b</sup>.</span>elements, all things made of them, or conteyned in them, except men and
angells. The vanity of the creature is in two points, 1. In the frustracion
of their end, which is twoefold, the service of God, that made them; 2d.
and the service of good men, for whom he made them. The 2d vanity,
that they are subject to corruption, not of annihilacion of matter, but decaying
in force and virtue.</p>

<p>The creatures, yf they had their owne will, would destroy the wicked
and save the godly alone. As the earth would open hir mouth and
swallowe them quicke, as it did Datham and Abiram. The lyons would
devoure them, as it did the accusers of Daniel, but shutt their mouths
against the innocent. The fier would burne them, as it did those which
cast the three children into the furnace. It hath bin obserued that as well
the influence of the heauens as the fertilnes of the earth is decayed, and
that the whole world is the worse for wearing, the heavens themselves
growing old as doth a garment.</p>

<p>2. God hath subdued the creature, for it is he alone that maketh the
sunne shine, and powreth downe rayne as well upon the good as the bad, &amp;c.
and the reason of this subjection is the synn of man; for all these being
created for mans vse, when he synned they were punished with him.</p>



<p>3. They shall be delivered from this bondage when there shalbe a newe
heaven and a newe earth; not that the substance of these shalbe abolished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
but a newe forme and perfection added, when they shall enjoy their ends
and be of religion. <span class="sidenote">fol. 87.<br>
Jan. 1602.</span>The elements shall melt with fyre, a comparison from
mettall which is melted not to be consumed, but to be purified and put in
forme.</p>

<p>The morall uses; 1. patiently to endure the afflictions of this life, for as
thoughe the Apostle should laye them in a balance to weighe them, he
sayth that the momentary afflictions of this lyfe are not worthy the waighte
of glory that is layed vp for us in the life to come.</p>

<p>We may truely say that the afflictions of these tymes wherein we liue
are not worthy the glory, for these are non, wee living in abundant
prosperity and peace, but tymes of persecution may come, wherein these
may be comfortable arguments; and, he said, that for ought he could see
the crosse was the proper badge and cognisaunce of a Christian. There
are soe many kindes of takinge; of takinge bribes, monie, gifts, &amp;c. that
there be fewe will take paynes with the creatures.</p>

<p>The creatures travayle togither with us, a metaphore taken from
travayle with child: which is caused from syn, and is a desyre to be
delivered.</p>



<p>When the sonnes of God shall be reuealed, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> when the number of
the elect be called, for whose sake the dissolucion of the world is deferred.
The Jewes must be conuerted before the world can be dissolued. He that
before the dissolucion of abbies had foretold what was <span class="sidenote">fo. 87<sup>b</sup>.</span>to happen unto
them for their fault and wickednes which liued in them, yf they had thereupon
repented and entred into a new course of lyfe, though this could not
perhaps haue stayed their dissolucion, yet it might haue saued themselves
in some better state; soe when men are foretold of the dissolucion of
the world, which is hastned and caused for our synnes, though our repentaunce
and amendment of lyfe cannot hinder the dissolucion, yet may it
be good for ourselves.</p>

they may well say they reade so: but I dare say they cannot reade soe in
the Scripture, they bely Christ when they say he said soe; he never spake
those words; it is a punishment for our synnes that wee cannot reade
right in this age. They are unlearned malitious that reade soe. The
word in the text originall is &#949;&#965;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;, derived of the particle &#949;&#965;, good,

<p>And by their reason they might as well deny the name of Maister, and
Father, for both are forbidden, as well as the other, and soe they might
quickly be amongst the Anabaptists, and overturne all difference and
jurisdicion. Lord is a name sometyme of place, and sometyme of
grace; and soe the ecclesiastike may haue it as well as the temporall, for
to the temporall it is a name of place onely, but the ecclesiasticall by their
merit may haue it of grace. Neither is it soe strange a title; Jacob useth
it to his brother Esau, and the prophet Isay takes it, my Lord, Adoni;
Christ acknowledged the name, and some of the Apostles did not refuse it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Kain spake to Habell;" it is not sett downe what he said: yet
some have adventured to say that he said <i>Transeamus in campos</i>, but
whatsoever it was it is not here mentioned, but left to be conceived, as in
iii. Gen. v. 22, least he put forth his hand [and] take alsoe of the tree of
lyfe: it is left what he resolved. Not that yf Adam had tasted of the
tree of lyfe that he should have liued for ever, noe more then he that
receives the Sacrament vnworthily shall be a member of Christs body, but
that was spoken <i>ironice</i>.</p>

<p>It is like he spake fayre words, being in the house in presence of his
father and mother, and that he used dissembling flattering speaches to
draw him to such a place where he might with aduantage execute his
purpose. A common practise in this world, and an old one, you see,
a Machiuilian tricke. They will match the diuel in this age, to carry
fayre countenaunce to him whome they meane to overthrowe; to glose and
insinuate, to offer hart roote and all, till he may take him at such
a vantage that he may cutt his throate or breake his necke, a familiar
fashion amongst the nobility in Court, not altogither unusuall amongst
the Clergy.</p>

<p>And when they were in the feild Kain rose up against his brother and
killed him, a pittifull and a wonderfull matter, will some say, that God
will suffer the wicked thus to murther the good; pittifull indeed, but not
wonderfull, for the synnes of the best have deserved greater punishment.</p>



<p>A strang thing those which were soe great frends, went arme in arme,
nowe mortall enimies upon the suddein. A maruelous strang <span class="sidenote">fo. 89<sup>b</sup>.<br>
Jan. 1602.</span>thinge
that he should knowe he could kill his brother, that he could dy, for
he never sawe any man dye before; but manie things are done, both good
and evil, by a secret instinct whereof a man sawe no reason til after the
thing performed, as Moses when he slewe the Agyptian.</p>

<p>Murder an auncient synn, the first open offence after the fall that was
committed in the world. Here a notable pollicy of the diuel to have
dammed up Gods glory and mans relligion, both at once.</p>

<p>Noe murderer at this day but is guilty of this murder of Kain, and all
since, since iniquity is sayd to be a measure which every synner in his
kinde by adding his synne striues to make full, and soe assents to all before
acted, like a conjuror that subscribes with his bloud.</p>

<p>"Where is Habel thy brother?" The Lord careth for the righteous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whoe answered, I cannot tell." He flaps God in the mouth with a ly
at the first word, a generall rule that after murder lying followeth, they are
links togither, and commonly noe syn committed but a lye runnes after: for
none is soe impudent to confesse it, euery one would have the face of virtue.</p>



<p>"Am I my brothers keeper?" See a Kings sonne, the heir of the world,
what a lob<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> it is! Howe like a clowne, a clunche,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> an asse, he aunswers.
A synner is the verryest noddy of all. This Kain was the verriest duns
in the world. He thought to have outfact God with [a] ly, and then would
excuse it; "Am I my brothers keeper?" I marry art thou, as thou wast

his people, the minister of the congregacion, every one of an other! The
greate ones would keep the minister poore and beggerly that they might
not tell them of their faults, but stopp the preists mouth with a coate or a
dynner; "but," sayd he, "the diuel take dynners giuen to such a purpose!"</p>

<p>His text, 59 of Isay, v. 12: "For our tresspasses are many before
thee, and our synnes testify against us, for our trespasses are with us,
and we knowe our iniquities."</p>

<p>He began with a commendacion of this prophet for the most eloquent
and evangelique, in soe much that St. Jerome said he might rather be
placed amongst the Evangelists then the Prophets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>All men are synners. "Our trespasses." When Christ taught his
disciples to pray, it was one peticion, "Forgive us our trespasses:" to lett
them knowe that they were his chosen disciples, yet they were not without
synn.</p>

<p>Some may say they have liued <i>sine crimine, sine querela, sed nemo
absque peccato</i>.</p>

<p>Hence we must learne not to be presumptuous, but to worke out our
salvacion with feare and trembling, since all are synners. 2. Not to despayre,
since the best haue synned.</p>

<p>Our synnes are before God, his eyes are 10,000 tymes brighter then
the sunne, nothing hid from his knowledge. Synne is like a smoke, like
fyre, it mounteth upward, and comes even before God to accuse us; it is
like a serpent in our bosome, still ready to sting us; it is the diuels
daughter. A woman hath hir paynes in travaile and delivery, but rejoyceth
when she seeth a child is borne; but the birth of synn is of a contrary
fashion; for all the pleasure [is] in the bringing forth, but when it
is finished and brought forth, it tormenteth us continually; they haunt us
like the tragicall furies.</p>

<p>"Lett him that readeth consider it." He said this chapter is not
to be understoode of doomesday, but of the destruction of Jerusalem;
and that the 28 v. "Wheresoever the dead carcase is, thither doe the
eagles resort," cannot be applied to the resurrection and congregacion
of the saints into state of glory with Christ, as some notes interpret, but
of the gathering togither of Christes people in the kingdome of grace:
for Christ in his kingdome of glory cannot be sayd a carcase, but nowe
he may, because he is crucified. And the 29 v. "The sunne shall be
darkened, and the moone shall not give hir light, and the stars shall fall
from heaven," he expounded thus, That the temporall and ecclesiasticall
state of the Jewes in Jerusalem, and the starres, i.&nbsp;e. their magistrates,
shall loose their authority.</p>

<p>He expounded the opening the seven seales in the Revelacion to have
reference to sundry tymes, and the 6. to the destruction of Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
7 tymes 7 makes a weeke of yeares, the Jewes true Jubilee, wherein 7

hath taken Christian and learned paynes therein, yet fayled in the computacion
of the beginning of the yeares.</p>

<p>The Revelacion might be better understood if men would better studye
it; and that it may be understood, and hath good use, he alledged the word,
1. 3. "Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the wordes of this
prophesy, and keepe those thinges which are written therein;" which were
vayne unles it might be understoode.</p>

<p>Towards the end of his sermon he told his auditory howe it had bin
bruited abroade, as he thought by some Atheists or Papists whose profest
enemy he is, that this last weeke he had hanged himselfe, but some of his
friends, he said, would not believe it, but said some other had done it; yet
others that like him not for some opinion, said it was noe marvaile yf he
hanged himselfe, for he had bin possest of the diuel a good while, "but I
thinke rather," said he, "they were possessed that said soe, and yet not
soe possessed as some hold possession now a dayes, that is essentially,"
and here he shewed his opinion that there can be noe essentiall possession:
1. Because the diuel can effect as much without entering into the person as
yf he were essentially in him, and then it is more then needes. 2. Because
there cannot be assigned anie proper token or signe to knowe that anie is
essentially possessed. Which signe must be apparent in all such as are
soe possessed, and not in anie others. This opinion of his, he said, he
would hold till he sawe better reason to the contrary.</p>


<p>In his sermon he told a tale of the Jewes Thalmud, which, he said, was
as true perhaps as anie in the Papists legend of lyes, and it was howe
Rabbi Haley had conference with Elias in a caue, and would knowe of
Elias when Messias should come. Elias told him, Goe aske of the Messias
himselfe. Rabbi Haley required where the Messias might be found. Elias
told him he should find him at Rome gates amongst the poore; a verry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>

<p>A yong man made a finicall boysterous exordium, and rann himselfe
out almost dry before he was halfe through; his text; "He humbled himselfe
to the death, even to the death of the crosse, wherefore God hath
glorified him." He spake much of humility. <i>Melior est peccator humilis,
quam superbus justus. Peccare non potest nisi superbus, nec penitere nisi
humilis.</i> He first dilated of three meanes to knowe God; by his greatnes,
by the prophets in the old, by his sonne in the newe Testament. Against
pride in beauty; the diuel playes the sophister whiles he perswades women
to paint that they may seeme fayrer than they are; which painting being
discovered, makes them to be thought fouler than they are. Pride in
apparell is pride of our shame, for it was made to cover it, and as yf one
should embroyder a sheete wherein he had done pennaunce, and shewe it
in bragging manner. It is said by some that St. John Baptist for his
humility is rewarded with the place which the diuel lost for his pride.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>He spake against duellisme, or single combat, and said that yf two goe
into the field with purpose to fight an the one be slayne, he is a murderour
of himselfe. He exhorted the judges to severity, telling them that
there is more incouragement taken by one that escapes the punishment
due unto him by the lawe, then there is feare wrought by the execution of
an hundred.</p>




<p class="section"><span class="sidenote">fo. 100.<br>
13 Feb. 1602.</span>In the afternoone <span class="smcap">Mr. Clapham</span>, at his Churche by Paules
Wharf.</p>

<p>Text, Gen. iv. 13. "Then Kain said to the Lord or Jehovah, My punishment
is greater then I can beare, &amp;c." but he reade it "My synne is
greater then can be concealed." He noted that translators did very ill to
foyst their inventions into the text and sett the originall in the margent, as
commonly the common translacions have "synne" in the margent for the
word "punishment" in the text, as grosse an absurdity as yf one should
shutt the master out of dores, and give entertainement to his attendants.</p>



<p>Nowe Kayne was prest with the horror of his synn he confesseth, but
with a kinde of desperacion and repining, as Judas when he confest
and hanged himselfe. If a man will not confesse his faultes he shall be
prest till he confesse, and when his confession comes to late he may
confesse and be hanged to, well enough. For repentant confession must
come while grace is offered, while it is called to-day. God deales as the
debtor which tenders his money till sunne goe downe. When night is
come, up goes his money and a fig for his creditor. Yf men take not tyme
while grace is offered, but delay till the sunne of grace be gonne downe,
there remaines nothing but horrible desperat reprobacion. A vagabond;
an excommunicate person is a vagabond, turned out of the society of Gods
Churche both here in earth, and in heaven too, yf it were done by the
Spirit of Christ; and therefore lett not men soe lightly esteeme of this
greate censure, nor thinke to excuse themselves by <span class="sidenote">fo. 100<sup>b</sup>.<br>

trifles; but lett them take heede they deserve it not, and yf they which
gave the sentence abused their authority, lett them aunswere for it, but
always the censure is to [be] reverently regarded.</p>

<p>Ther be pasport-makers that are as verry rogues as any justice rogues,
noble rogues; all that live out of the communion of the Churche are noe
better than rogues and vagabonds in the eye [?] of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

lyfe is the sweetest lyfe; yf thou livest the lyfe of a shepheard,
thou livest the sweetest private. Wilt thou be a king? Be a shepheard,
thou hast subjects, thou hast obedient subjects, thou hast
sheepe, thou hast a scepter, thou hast a crooke; thy fold is thy
counsell chamber, and the greene field thy flourishing pallace.
Thy companions are the sunne, the moone, and the stars, of whom
thou makest continuall use, and from the vieue of their lights receyvest
thy counsell and advise. Thou art more happie then other
kings, thou art freed from hate and soe from feare, thou reignest
quietly, and rulest securely; thou hast but one enemie, and thou
hast an enemy for that enemie, the dog and wolf. He that
was Gods second best beloved was a shepheard and a king; yf thou
art a shepheard thou art a king, thou art happie, nay thou art
most happie, thou art a happie king, thy subiectes living onely to
lengthen thy life, and to shorten their owne, &amp;c.</p>

made a sermon at Paules Crosse, his text, Luke xii. v. 13, 14,
&amp;c.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
<p>"Take heede of covetousnes, for though a man have abundaunce, his
life standeth not in riches." 2 parts; a caveat. 2. the reason. The reason
by a negative, 1. Mans lyfe not in abundance. 2. by a similitude. He
noted a difference between the Syriack and the Greeke. The Syriac
sayth Christ spake to his disciples; the Greeke to the brethren that
strove for the inheritaunce.</p>

<p>In the caveat, considered 1. the giver, Christ; 2. the brevity; 3. the
occasion, the falling out of brethren.</p>

<p>All that followe Christ are his disciples.</p>

<p>The giver is Christ, which is Amen, <i>verax</i>, omniscient, he that knowes
the waye of the serpent upon the stone, of an arrowe in the ayre, and a ship
in the sea. <i>Multa habent auctoritatem propter dicentem.</i> He can tell us
<i>latet anguis in herba</i>. The two eyes of the lambe a great watchman to tell
us the danger of synn, that it hath the face of a woman, but the sting of a
scorpion.</p>



<p>Brevitye. One word of Christ a whole sermon&mdash;the ten commaundments
are called but ten words, Deut. iv. 13. The whole have but one
word, Love, of God and our neighbour, &#8001; &#8033;&#957;,
&#8001; &#949;&#7985;,
&#8001;  &#7953;&#961;&#967;&#948;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#991;, &#945;
and &#969;.
One word of God overthrewe the whole kingdome of Assyria. Adams
synn was the breach but of one commaundement, yet condemned the whole
world. Relligion is one, though questions be infinit, <span class="sidenote">fo. 104<sup>b</sup>.</span>yet all must be determined
<i>per unum verbum domini scriptum</i>. <i>Verbum indicabit</i>, all must be
resolved <i>per primam veritatem</i>. Our soule can never be quiet till it be
resolved by the word of God. Neither can wee have any perfection till
wee have a seed of God.</p>

<p>Some have gone about to shewe the truth of relligion by casting out
divels. David must come out with his two stones, the Old and the Newe
Testament, before Goliah can be slayne.</p>

<p>He would not speake against the good use of riches. <i>Divitiæ nec putentur
mala, quia dantur bonis; neque bona, quia conferuntur malis.</i> Though the
soule neede none of these goods of riches, yet the body doth, <i>propter victum
et vestitum</i>, and therefore we pray, <i>Da nobis hodie panem nostrum
quotidianum</i>. God is the author of them, and soe, being the gifts of God,
they cannot be evil in their nature. Diverse virtues followe and depend
upon riches; as magnificence, munificence, &amp;c.; hence have these goodly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
churches beene builded, famous colledges found[ed], warrs maynteyned, &amp;c.
The use of riches is to serve our owne necessity, Gods glory; to doe
good to the poore, to lend to the needy, to reward the virtuous, to make
frend of, &amp;c. Yet the gift cannot merrit, for yf I give all that I have,
yet yf I want charitie, &amp;c. Yet <i>facta in fide Mediatoris</i>, they shall not
want a reward. "Come ye blessed of my Father, when I was naked you
clothed me," &amp;c. The abuse of riches is covetousnes. Covetousnes is an
Hydra with seven heades, the diuel is the author of it. He tempted
Christ with riches, when he shewed him &#948;&#8001;&#958;&#945;&#957;, the glory of the world; the
diuel could make shewes, he was a cunning juggler.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 105.</div>

<p>The second head, the name, which is an ill name, to covet house, land,
&amp;c. allways taken in the ill part; <i>avaritia</i>, in Latin, <i>aviditas æris</i>, &#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#7985;&#945;;
not a good name amongst them all.</p>

<p>3. The daughters of covetousnes: 1. <i>Rapina</i>, robbery. 2. &#966;&#953;&#955;&#945;&#961;&#947;&#965;&#961;&#7985;&#945;.
3. <i>Oppressio.</i> 4. <i>Furtum.</i> 5. <i>Homicidium.</i> 6. <i>Proditio.</i> 7. <i>Fallacia.</i>
8. <i>Mendacia.</i> 9. <i>Obduratio.</i> Whereof more at this day then the Bishop
of Constance burnt poore people in a barne which came for a dole.
10. <i>Usuria.</i> This rangeth abroad over the whole land. 11. Bribery. 12.
<i>Symonia</i>, Lady Symonie, a shameles on. 13. <i>Sacrilegium.</i> The end <i>Superbia</i>,
which conteines all, and holds all things to base for himselfe.</p>

<p>Fourth head, the effects of covetousnes: 1. Hatred. 2. Misery. 3. Contempt.
4. Forgetfulnes of God. 5. <i>Suffocatio</i>, sorrowe. 6. Danger, death
of body and soule; howe many have bin slayne for riches, or dyed in them.</p>

<p>Fifth head, it is the roote of all evill. 1 Tim. vi. 10; it is an euill of
generality. Some nations are sicke but of one vice; but he that hath this,
hath all; it is hardly cured, it growes by continuance, <i>peccatum clamans</i>,
it is <i>maxime inimicum Deo</i>, for hee gave all by creacion to all equally, but
this strives to drawe all to it selfe most unequally. Of such a man it
is sayd <i>abstulit a pauperibus, congregavit, et manet in æternum ejus infamia</i>.</p>

<p>Sixth head, similitudes, all evill; it is compared to the dropsy, a disquieting
kinde of thirst; to leaches, which sucke till they burst.</p>



<p>7. The end, he gathers he knowes not for whom; the reason, mans
life consists not in the abundance of riches, 1. Because both when wee
came into the world, though wee were naked, yet wee then lived, and
<span class="sidenote">fo. 105<sup>b</sup>.</span>before that too. 2. Wee shall carry nothing away with us when we dye,
yet our soules shall live. 3. They cannot deliver us from death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>Riches are incertayne, and therefore Eschines compares them to Euripus,
which ebbes and flowes oftentymes in a day. An other says they are
winged, because the[y] passe away soe swiftly; and Fortune hir selfe is
allways painted upon a wheeling stone, to note the inconstancy of riches;
and certaine it is that, at last, yf they part not from us, wee must part
from them.</p>

<p>The parable. A riche man, though he be riche, yet he must dye; for
he is but a man. God would have some riche, some poore, for distinction
sake, and the mutuall exercise of liberality and patience, whereby the
opinion of the Anabaptists is easily confuted, whoe would have all things
alike common; <i>admirabilis concatenatio</i> in the order of things and states.
God made noe miraculous provision for his disciples, therefore there ought
to be an ordinary provision for the ministery. As the people love the
ministers for their spirituall blessings, soe the ministers love the people
for their temporall commodities. The order of professions. 1. Relligion.
2. Husbandry. 3. Merchandise. 4. Souldiery.</p>

<p>Abuse <i>in acquirendo, concupiscendo, consumendo</i>.</p>

<p>The covetous man reasons with himselfe in his bed: where wee should
<i>bonum omissum, malum commissum, tempus amissum, deflere</i>. David sayth,
"Lord, I remember the in my bed."</p>

<p>"I will pull doune;" surely he was a man of this age, pul downe colledges,
churches, cyties, kingdomes; every one cryes "Downe with Jerusalem!"
An easy matter to pull downe that which was in building forty yeares; he
will build it agen, soe will not many an other doe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 106.</div>

<p>The foole when his owne belly is full thinkes all the worlde hath
enoughe. "Eate soule! drinke soule!" a hog may say as much. I
will pull downe, I will build; here is all "I," nothing but himselfe. Presumption
that he shall enjoy all; whence he noted his infidelity, security,
carnality, &#949;&#965;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#955;&#7985;&#945;.</p>

<p>Of the soule. The soule is the image of God, <i>Christi redempta sanguine,
hæres cum angelis, capax cælestis beatitudinis, simplex, immortalis,
incorporea</i>. It useth <i>organa</i>, instruments. God giveth, not man begge[tte]th
it. 21 Exod. 22. <i>Creando infunditur, infundendo creatur.</i> God
is the father of soules, and the soule returneth to God that gave it; Ecclesiastes.
<i>Anima imago Dei, in justitia et dominio.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Relligion of the Turk more towards their Alcoran then our[s] to the
Scripture; speake but against that there it is death. He that dishonoureth
his father, or disobeyeth the magistrat, every where punished, but for Gods
dishonour fewe take care or vengeance.</p>

<p>This thought he spake to himselfe, but God puls him by the sleeve, and
calls him by his name, "Thou foole!"</p>

<p>The godly give up their soules, but the soules of the wicked are taken
from them.</p>

<p class="section"><span class="sidenote">fo. 107<sup>b</sup>.</span>Notes of a sermon upon the xv. ch. to the Corinth, verse 22.</p>

<p>"As in Adam all dye, soe in Christ shall all men be made alive." The
judgement of the first disobedience was death. And in truth, God could
doe noe lesse, unlesse he would be unjust, for as in wisdome he had ordayned
that man should dye when he tasted the fruit of the forbidden tree,
soe in justice he was to execute what in wisdom he had decreed.</p>

<p>Christ was like Adam in his preheminence, in being the cheife and
having goverment over all creature[s]. But yet unlike in this that Adam
was the cause of death, but Christ is the cause of lyfe unto all that beleeve
in him. There is a tyme for all to dye: and this act of dying is done by
us, and upon us. It is a sentence which comprehendeth all, though all
apprehend not it. Adam was one before all, one ouer all, and all in one,
by whose synn all taynted; soe Christ, by whom all saved. 1 Tim. ii. 4.
Man is the principall cause in the course of generacion, but woman was in
the fall of Adam. 1 Tim. ii. 14. Those which are sicke of the wantonnes
make many answereles, endles, needeles questions, about the fall of Adam.</p>

<p>Notes of a Sermon upon Matthew v. 17.</p>

<p>"Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe, or the prophets: I
am not come to destroy them, but to fullfill them." The best could not
live free from slaunders, as Nehemias was charged to have rebelled, &amp;c.
and Christ himselfe could not escape the malitious censures of the wicked.
When he cured the sicke of the palsy saying, Thy synnes bee forgiven
thee, these whispered in their hartes, and called that speache blasphemy.
When he disposs[ess]ed the man that was vexed with a deuil, they said he
cast out deuils by Beelzebub the prince of the deuils. When he suffered
for us they sayd he was plagued for his owne offences. But Augustine
sayth well of these men; "<i>Hoc facilius homo suspicatur in altero, quod
sentit in seipso.</i>"</p>



<p>The lawe stretcht noe further then the outward action, but Christ layes
it to the secret thought. Synnes in our thoughtes are like a snake in our
bosome, which may kill us yf wee nurse it; it is like fyre to gunpowder.
Wee must shake synn from our thoughts, as wee would a spark from our
garments, lest yf wee be once sett on fyre with them all our teares shall
not quenche them. The divel puts synn in our thoughtes, as a thiefe
<span class="sidenote">fo. 109.</span>thrusts a boy in at a windowe, to open the dore for the great ones. Yf
syn enter into the heart it becomes like a denn of thieves, and like a cage
of uncleane birds.</p>

<p>Synn a sly thing; it will enter at the windowe, at the casement, at a
chinke of our cogitations.</p>

<p>I was at the Court at Richemond, to heare Dr. Parry one of hir
Majesties chaplens preache, and to be assured whether the Queene
were living or dead. I heard him, and was assured shee was then
living. His text was out of the Psalme [cxvi. 18, 19] "Nowe
will I pay my vowes unto the Lord in the middest of the congregacion,"
&amp;c. It was a verry learned, eloquent, relligious, and moving
sermon: his prayer, both in the beginning and conclusion, was soe
fervent and effectuall for hir Majestie that he left few eyes drye.</p>




<p class="section">The doctrine was concerning vowes, which were growne in contempt
and hatred, because the Jews of old and the Papists of later tymes have
used them, whereas the thing itselfe, in its owne nature, is reasonable and
commendable. Wee owe all that wee have, that wee are, vnto God; and
all that wee can doe is but our bounden duty, yet those offices may seeme
to please him best, and be most gratefull, [in] which even besydes those
dutyes which he requires; wee doe enter of our owne will as it were into
a newe, a neere[r] bond. And he defined it to be a promise made unto God,
to performe some service in such manner as we are not otherwise bound
by duty to performe. It must be made to God, soe differs from other
promises; it must be voluntary, and soe it differs from required dutyes;
it must be deliberate, which takes away rashnes; it must be of thinges

<p>I dyned with Dr. Parry in the Priuy Chamber, and understood
by him, the Bishop of Chichester, the Deane of Canterbury, the
Deane of Windsore, &amp;c. that hir Majestie hath bin by fitts troubled
with melancholy some three or four monethes, but for this fortnight
extreame oppressed with it, in soe much that shee refused to
eate anie thing, to receive any phisike, or admit any rest in bedd,
till within these two or three dayes. Shee hath bin in a manner
speacheles for two dayes, verry pensive and silent; since Shrovetide
sitting sometymes with hir eye fixed upon one obiect many howres
togither, yet shee alwayes had hir perfect senses and memory, and
yesterday signified by the lifting up of hir hand and eyes to heaven,
a signe which Dr. Parry entreated of hir, that shee beleeved that
fayth which shee hath caused to be professed, and looked faythfully
to be saved by Christes merits and mercy only, and noe other meanes.
She tooke great delight in hearing prayers, would often at the name
of Jesus lift up hir handes and eyes to Heaven. Shee would not
heare the Arch[bishop] speake of hope of hir longer lyfe, but when
he prayed or spake of Heaven, and those ioyes, shee would hug his
hand, &amp;c. It seemes shee might have lived yf she would have used
meanes; but shee would not be persuaded, and princes must not be
forced. Hir physicians said shee had a body of a firme and perfect
constitucion, likely to have liued many yeares. A royall Maiesty
is noe priviledge against death.</p>




<p class="section"><span class="sidenote">fo. 111<sup>b</sup>.<br>
24 Mar. 1602.</span>This morning about three at clocke hir Majestic departed this
lyfe, mildly like a lambe, easily like a ripe apple from the tree, <i>cum
leue quadam febre, absque gemitu</i>. Dr. Parry told me that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
present, and sent his prayers before hir soule; and I doubt not
but shee is amongst the royall saints in Heaven in eternall joyes.</p>


<p class="section">About ten at clocke the Counsel and diverse noblemen having
bin a while in consultacion, proclaymed James the 6, King of Scots,
the King of England, Fraunce, and Irland, beginning at Whitehall
gates; where Sir Robert Cecile reade the proclamacion which
he carries in his hand, and after reade againe in Cheapside. Many
noblemen, lords spirituell and temporell, knights, five trumpets,
many heraulds. The gates at Ludgate and portcullis were shutt and
downe, by the Lord Maiors commaund, who was there present,
with the Aldermen, &amp;c. and untill he had a token besyde promise,
the Lord Treasurers George, that they would proclayme the King
of Scots King of England, he would not open.</p>

<p>Upon the death of a King or Queene in England the Lord Maior
of London is the greatest magistrate in England. All corporacions
and their governors continue, most of the other officers authority is
expired with the princes breath. There was a diligent watch and
ward kept at every gate and street, day and night, by housholders,
to prevent garboiles: which God be thanked were more feared then
perceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 112.<br>
24 Mar. 1602.</div>

<p>The proclamacion was heard with greate expectacion and silent
joye, noe great shouting. I thinke the sorrowe for hir Majesties
departure was soe deep in many hearts they could not soe suddenly
showe anie great joy, though it could not be lesse then exceeding
greate for the succession of soe worthy a king. And at night they
shewed it by bonefires, and ringing. Noe tumult, noe contradicion,
noe disorder in the city; every man went about his busines, as
readylie, as peaceably, as securely, as though there had bin noe
change, nor any newes ever heard of competitors. God be thanked,
our king hath his right! <i>Magna veritas et prevalet.</i></p>



<p>Doubtles there was grave wise counsell and deliberacion in fact;
<i>sed factum est hoc a Domino</i>, we must needes confessse, and I hope
wee may truly say, <i>nobis parta quies</i>. The people is full of expec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tacion,
and great with hope of his worthines, of our nations future
greatnes; every one promises himselfe a share in some famous action
to be hereafter performed for his prince and country. They assure
themselves of the continuance of our Church goverment and
doctrine. Their talke is of advauncement of the nobility, of the
subsidies and fifteenes taxed in the Queenes tyme; howe much
<span class="sidenote">fo. 112<sup>b</sup>.<br>
Marche, 1602.</span>indebted shee died to the Commons, notwithstanding all those charges
layed upon them. They halfe despayre of payment of their privey
seales, sent in Sir William Ceciles tyme; they will not assure themselves
of the lone. One wishes the Earl of Southampton and others
were pardoned and at liberty; others could be content some men of
great place might pay the Queenes debts, because they beleeve they
gathered enough under hir. But all long to see our newe king.</p>

<p>This evening prayer at Paules the King was publikely prayed for
in forme as our Queene used to be.</p>

<p>The Lord Hunsdon was in his coache at Paules Hill beyond
Ludgate, to attend the proclamacion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Thompson</span>, Deane of Windsore, whoe at thys tyme attendes
still with Dr. Parry as Chaplein, was by course to have preached
this day, but <span class="smcap">Dr. King</span> was appointed and performed that duty.</p>


<p class="section">His text was the Gospell for this day, the xi. of Luke and the 14.
verse, and soe forward. He prayed for the King, that as God had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
him an head of gold, soe hee would give him a golden brest, golden legs
and feet alsoe; that as he had a peaceable and quiet entrance, soe he
would graunt him a wise and happie goverment, and a blessed ending,
whensoever he should take him from us. That it would please God to
laye his roote soe deepe that he may flourishe a long tyme, and his
braunches never fayle. The summe of his text in these parts; 1. A diuel
cast out. 2. The dumb speake. 3. The multitude wonder. 4. The Scribes
and Pharisees slander. 5. Christ confuteth. 6. A woman confesseth.
The ende of Christs comming was to dissolve the workes of the diuel,
whereof possession was not the meanest. Can there be a greater then to
take the temple of the Holy Ghost, and make it the sell and shrine of
the diuels image?</p>

<p><i>Non requiritur intelligendi vivacitas, sed credendi simplicitas.</i></p>

<p><i>Indocti c&oelig;lum rapiunt, dum nos cum doctrina nostra trudimur in infernum.</i></p>

<p>The workes of Christ, his miracles, were manifest, <i>posuit in sole tabernaculum</i>:
he cast out a diuel, they sawe it, they could not deny it, but
then, what malice could, they deprave the fact or diminishe and eclipse his
glory.</p>

<p><i>Judei signum quærunt.</i> Julian cals it the rusticity of fayth, as though
none but the simple rude multitude beleeve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 114.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</div>

<p><i>Invidia non quærit quid dicat, sed tantum ut dicat.</i></p>

<p>The envious and malitious live onely in contradiction, like the bettle in
dung and filthines. They said not that Christ could not cast out a diuel,
and soe denyed his power, which is a synn against the Holy Ghost, but
they said himselfe was possessed, nay more that he was Belzeebub.</p>

<p>Beelzebub signifies an idoll of flyes: because there was soe much bloud
spilt in sacrifice before it that many flyes bred and lived upon it.</p>

<p>Christ confuted them by four reasons: 1. From autority; a maxime
and rule in all policy, that a kingdome divided against itselfe cannot stand.
2. From example. By whom doe your children, his apostles and disciples
he meanes, cast them out? Yf they doe it by the finger of God, then
must I, except the same thing be not the same, yf other persons doe it.
Atticus and Ru ... (<i>idem non idem si non per eundem</i>) unles they will
allowe the thing and condemne the person. But he said, <i>testes mei judices
vestri</i>. 3. From a similitude of a stronge and a stronger man, two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
warlike men, yf one keepe possession, he must be stronger that puts him
out: soe he must be greater than the diuel that can cast him out. 4. From
the contrary; the repugnancy betwixt Christ and the diuel.</p>



<p>He insisted most upon his first reason, of intestine discord: which he
said is like a consumption; as yf the head should pull out the eye, or the
mouth refuse to eate because the belly receives it, &amp;c. This is that plague
that Aegypt shall fight against Aegypt, brother against brother. In the
<span class="sidenote">fo. 114<sup>b</sup>.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</span>11 of Zacharia there are two staves mentioned, the one of beauty, the
other of bonds; it is a grevous plague which is there threatened, <i>dissolvam
germanitatem eorum</i>, their brotherhood of Judah and Israel. Ephraim
against Manasse and Manasse against Ephraim, two tribes of the same
family: the incomparable miseryes of Jerusalem by intestine sedicion.
<i>Auxilia humana firma consensus facit.</i> Agesilaus shewed his armed men,
a mind in consent for defence of the city, and said, <i>Hij sunt muri Spartæ,
scutum hærens scuto, galeæ galea, atque viro vir</i>. Friends at discord are
most deadly enimyes, and those thinges which before were <i>ligamenta
amoris</i> became then <i>incitamenta furoris</i>. The greatest wrongs are most
eagerly pursued; such are commonly the causes for which frends fall out.
<i>Quasi musto inebrientur sanguine.</i></p>

<p>Even the diuel must have his due; it was commendable that a legion
of them could dwell togither in one man without discord amongst themselves;
scarse a few in one house but some jar betwixt them. Yet their
concord was not <i>ex amicitia, sed ex communi malitia</i>, like Herod and Pilat.
<i>Aliquod bonum absque malo, sed nullum malum absque aliquo bono</i>,
even in the diuels their essence and their order is good.</p>

<p>There is a tyme to gather, said he, and a tyme to scatter, but he had
scattered what he had scarce any tyme to gather; his comming up to this
place being <i>tanquam fungus e terra</i>, an evening and a morning being the
whole tyme allotted for meditacion, and disposicion.</p>


<p>Wee may not be unmindefull of our late Soverayne whom God hath
called to his mercy, nor ought wee be unthankefull for our newe
<span class="sidenote">fo. 115.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</span>
suffected joy, by the suddein peaceable succession of our worthy king.</p>

<p>The finger of the Spirit directed the Churche, and the order of [the] Church
leads me (said he) to the choise of this text, being the Gospell for this day.
There are that have slandered, but they are Scribes and Pharisees; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
that being the worst part of this text, he would passe over it. There were
feares and foretellinges of miseries like to fall upon us at these times, but
blessed be the God of peace, that hath settled peace amongst us. Blessed
be the God of truth that his kingdome came unto us long since, and I hope
shall continue even till the comming of Christ; and blessed be the father
of lights, that wee see the truth, and be not scattered.</p>

<p>The miracle of dispossession. Wee have seene the exile of the diuel out
of our country, his legends, his false miracles, exorcismes, superstitions,
&amp;c. and lett him goe walking through dry places, wee are watered with
heavenly deawe, and wee hope he shall never returne againe; but the favour
of God towards us shall be like the kindenes of Ruth, more at the latter
end than it was at the beginning.</p>



<p>Our State hath sustayned some division of late. "I meane not," sayd
he, "of the myndes of great nobles and counsellors, wherein to our good
and comfort wee have found <i>idem velle et idem nolle</i>, but such a division
as of the body and soule, of the vine and the branches, of the husband
<span class="sidenote">fo. 115<sup>b</sup>.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</span>and the wife, of the head and the body. The prince and the land hath
bin divided by hir death, a division without violence. This applying the
axe to the roote made the tree bleed at the verry heart."</p>




<p>This Gospell makes mention of an excellent woman that sang not to
hir selfe and hir muses, but went amongst the multitude, and blessed an
other woman more excellent then hirselfe; yet soe blessed hir as a
mother for hir babes sake. Soe there are two excellent women, one
that bare Christ and an other that blessed Christ; to these may wee
joyne a thrid that bare and blessed him both. Shee bare him in
hir heart as a wombe, shee conceived him in fayth, shee brought
him forth in aboundaunce of good workes, and nurst him with favors
and protection: shee blessed him in the middest of a froward and wicked
generacion, when the bulls of Bazan roared, and the unholie league, and
bound themselves with oathes and cursings against the Lord and his
annoynted. "And am I entred into hir prayses," said he; "and nowe is
the tyme of prayse, for prayse none before their death; and then <i>gratissima
laudis actio cum nullus fingendi aut assentandi locus relinguitur</i>. Yet
such prayses are but like a messe of meate sett upon a dead mans grave
which he cannot tast, or like a light behind a mans back which cannot
him direct." He would say little, <i>non quod ingratus, sed quod oppressus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
multitudine et magnitudine rerum dicendarum</i>. Onely he would say that
<span class="sidenote">fo. 116.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</span>
hir government had bin soe clement, temperat and godly, that he may
say <i>sic imbuti sumus, non possumus nisi optimum ferre</i>. Those which in
Theodosius the Emperours tyme went to Rome called their travel <i>felix
peregrinatio</i>, because they had seen Rome, they had seen Theodosius,
they had seene Rome and Theodosius togither; soe have and may strangers
that have bin to visit our kingdome thinke them selves happie that
[they] had seene England and Queen Elizabeth, and England and Queene
Elizabeth togither. But there are panegyricks provided for hir, faythfully
registred, and as she merited. Shee was <i>preteritis melior</i>, better
then those which went before hir, and may be a precedent to those that
shall followe hir; the taking hir from us was a great division, but God
hath sowed it up againe; it was a grevious sore, but God hath healed it;
he hath given us a worthy successor, a sonne of the nobles; one that is
fleshe of our fleshe. God seemes to say unto us, "Open thy mouth wide
and I will fill it with aboundant blessing;" he may say as he did to his vine,
"what should I have done that I have not done unto thee, O England?"
Noe vacancy, noe interregnum, noe interruption of goverment, as in
Rome an[d] other places, where in such tymes the prisons fly open, &amp;c.
but a quiet, a peaceable, and present succession of such a King, <i>quem
populus et proceres voce petebant</i>; the best wished and the onely agreed
upon. The Lord from his holy sanctuary blesse him in his throne!
<span class="sidenote">fo. 116<sup>b</sup>.<br>
27 Mar. 1603.</span>It was noe shame for Solomon to walke in the wayes of his father David;
neither can it be a dishonour for our King to walke in the steps of his
mother and predecessor. Lett the foster-sonne and sonnes sonne continue
their glory, grace, and dignity, and never lett him want one of his
seede to sit upon his seate.</p>

<p>Then to the nobles for their wise menaging those greate affayres,
"<i>Utinam retribuat Dominus</i>," said he, "and, as Nehemias prayed for himselfe,
'Remember them, O God! in goodnes.' Your peace," said he,
"continued ours, and long may you continue in firme alledgeance to doe
your prince and country service in wisdome, honour, and piety." And this
is noe <i>detractio, sed attractio; impius in tenebris latet</i>, he holds his peace,
but Lord open thou our lips, and our mouth shall shewe forth thy prayse;
<i>Paratum est cor meum</i>, My heart is ready, my heart is ready, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><span class="sidehead">fo. 121<sup>b</sup>.<br>
8 Aprill 1603.</span><span class="smcap">At White Hall.</span></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Montague</span>, Master of Sydney Colledge in Cambridge, made a
sermon; his text Matt xviii. 11. "The Sonne of Man came to save that
which was lost."</p>

<p>In his prayer: "Wee give ourselves to synn, without restraint in our conscience
before, or remorse after." He considered 3 points: 1. The stile of
Christ; the Sonne of Man. 2. To whom he came; to the lost. 3. The end
of his coming; to save. Where men come of an honourable parentage,
or beare an office of dignity, it is their use to stile themselves in the name
of their auncesters, as Solomon the sonne of David, &amp;c. But where they
have none, the Jewes call them Ben Adam, the sonne of man. Howe
happens it then that Christ which is <i>Salvator mundi</i>, &#931;&#969;&#964;&#7969;&#961;, the best word
that the Greekes have, that he takes upon him this stile of basenes?
For two reasons: 1. Because the nearer he came to our nature, the
neerer he came to our name; first before the lawe he was called <i>Semen
mulieris</i>, then <i>Shilo</i>, after <i>Messias</i>, and nowe himselfe gives himselfe this
name, the Sonne of Man, by speciall effect changing his name; when he
was Silo wee were but servants, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He layd downe his name to take up ours, that wee might for his sake
lay downe our lives to take up his glory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 122.<br>
8 Aprill 1603.</div>

<p>He would not have his glory upon earth: he would never suffer himselfe
to be called God upon earth, nor suffer his miracles to be blazoned,
he would have his fame spread by the inward persuasion of the spirit
not the outward applause of the mouth. And hence he noted the difference
betwixt the fame of a magistrat and of a minister; for from the
outward action of the magistrat we come to an inward approbacion of his
virtue; but contrary in a minister, from our inward perswasion of his virtue
to the outward approbacion of his actions.</p>

<p>Exinanition [Exaninition] of Christs glory on earth typified in the
auncient Jewish manner of coronacion, and enthronizing their kings, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
they powred a horne of oyle upon his head, to shewe that as the horne
was emptied to annoint him, soe out of his fullnes he should enrich others.
Oyle is taken for grace.</p>



<p>Second point; to those that were lost. The Rabbins devide all the
people into three sorts, <i>Sapientes</i>, such were the Scribes and Pharises;
2. <i>Sapientum filij</i>, such as held nothing for opinion, nor did any
thing for action, but that which was approved by the Pharisees;
3. <i>Terræ filij</i>, the children of the world, publicans and synners, reputed
as lost sheepe: to these Christ came, and for conversing with these he
<span class="sidenote">fo. 122<sup>b</sup>.<br>
8 Aprill 1603.</span>was obrayded; to teache men what a different course there is in the managing
of heavenly and earthly things. The greate affayres of the world
begin at the Prince, and soe are derived by a long course to the people,
but the matters of heaven begin in the people, and soe rise up to the
Prince. The first newes of Christs birth was brought but to a company of
silly shepheards, from them to a poore city, Bethleem, from thence to
Jerusalem, and soe by calculacion it was neere two yeares before it came
to the Kings eare.</p>

<p>There are two Kingdomes in this world, a temporall and a spirituall or
mysticall, eache needing other. Where the rich feeling their poverty in
spirituell, come to the minister to be furnished in that commodity, and the
minister feeling his wants in the riches of this lyfe, followeth great men,
to be relieved in that necessity. <i>Communis indigentia est societatis vinculum</i>,
mutuall necesity is the surcingle of the world.</p>



<p>Second reason; Christ came to these, as the fittest to receive his doctrine,
and yet it is clapt in amongst his miracles that the poor beleeved. The
promises of a kingdome in heaven is a greate matter which greate men
according to their course in earth will hardly beleeve can be effected without
greate meanes, and therefore a miracle yf princes receive Christ. Our
<span class="sidenote">fo. 123.<br>
8 Aprill 1603.</span>Prince did, and our King doth continue this miracle; for shee did, and he
doth, hold and will maintaine the truth of the Gospell, "and this hath
king'd him," said he.</p>

<p>Two conclusions; better to be a lost sheepe in the wild field, then put
up safe in the fold of the Pharisees.</p>

<p>There have bin three great monarchies in the world, the first of Synn, the
second of the Lawe, the third of Grace, and these had severall ends; the
first was death, the next Christ, and the last is lyfe; and these were at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>tained
by severall meanes, for synn brought us to death by concealment
of our faults, the lawe brought us to Christ by knowing our syn, by revealing
our syn, and Christ by his grace leads us to everlasting lyfe. In
each soule those three kingdomes have their succession yf it be saved.
Though the lawe was delivered with thunder, yet there insued comfort in
the first word, "I am thy God." The lawe like a bason of water with a
glas by it, serves to discover, and scower away the filthines.</p>



<p>Second conclusion. Noe syn soe greate that should discourage us from
comminge to Christ. Aesculapius, as the poets faine, dewised more remedys
against poison out of a serpent than any other creature, yet the serpent more
poisonous in it selfe then anie man. Soe from syn. Our confidence, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>
from the nature of God, whoe regards not soe muche what a man hath
bin, but what he is, and will bee. Whereas the judgment of man, on the
contrary, is ground[ed] upon <i>vita anteacta</i>, and forepassed actions; soe
<span class="sidenote">fol. 123<sup>b</sup>.<br>
Aprill 1603.</span>Ananias made conjecture of Paule. God more delights to pardon the synner,
then to punish the synne.</p>

<p>2. From the nature of Christ; more mild and mercyfull than Moses: for
Christ never executed any point of judgment. He is an intercessor, and shall
be our judge: but that tyme is not come, soe our creede notes, "From thence
He shall come to judge." And this seemes to be the reason, that under
the lawe, yf anie strang syn had escaped the hand of the magistrat, yet it
was usually punished by the hand of God: whereas nowe, yf offences slip
the magistrat, they are seldome or neuer revenged from heaven.</p>

<p>Christ is not soe muche a remedy for easy synns, but even for such
synners as even beginn to stink and rott in them, as Lazarus did in the
grave. Shee that had hir issue 12 yeares was healed with the touch of
his garment, &amp;c. He is more ready to pardon a synner upon repentance
then to punishe him upon perseverance.</p>

<p>3. The end: To save. Chrîstus salvat; solutione debiti et applicatione
remedij. Debitum nostrum 2<sup>x</sup>; Obedientiæ; P&oelig;næ.</p>

<p>Wee must obey the lawe or indure the punishment. Christ by his lyfe
hath payd the dett of our obedience, and by his death had cleered the
debt of our punishment. Both were necessary to our plenary redemption:
his life to ripe age to accomplishe our righteousnes; his passion by death
to meritt of [<i>sic</i>] our salvacion. Righteousnes of his lyfe. Merit of his
passion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">fo. 124.<br>
Aprill 1603.</div>



<p>The applicacion; by taking upon him our syns, and imputing unto
us his righteousnes. In all synn, three things, <i>culpas</i>, <i>reatus</i>, <i>p&oelig;na</i>, and
the remedy must have something contrary to the malignant quality of the
disease: soe Christ cureth the fault by his obedience, the guilt by his
innocency, and the punishment by his passion; soe by applicacion all our
synns are his. All his righteousnes is become ours. But heere surges <a name="tn_png_189"></a><!--TN: "a a" changed to "a"-->a
doubt, howe it comes to passe that synce the imputacion of his merits
makes us righteous, the imputacion of our synn cannot make him synfull.
<i>Ferrum candens absorbet aquam</i>, and the drop of our synn cannot infect
the ocean of his innocency; <i>finiti ad infinitum nulla proportio</i>. The applicacion
of our syn to him is but a mere imputacion, but his merits, beside an
imputacion, worke in us alsoe an inherent righteousnes. For applicacion; the
commaundments are given in the second person; and the bible written in
fashion of a story, not precepts and rules, because it is more for practise
then speculacion, and God would have us rather good Christians then good
schollers. Without particular applicacion all is nothinge but like the
rude chaos, for before the incubacion of the Spirit of God, there was noe
separacion, noe vilificacion, noe animacion. In the sacrifice in the old
lawe it was noe idle thing that they were to sprinkle the right eare, the
<span class="sidenote">fo. 124<sup>b</sup>.<br>
Aprill 1603.</span>right thombe, and the right foote too, to shewe the inward affection must
be moved by the eare, and the action by the thomb and the toe.</p>



<p>The Virgin liked the newes well which was brought hir, "but howe
shall this come to passe," quoth shee; soe it is welcome to every one to
heere that he shall be the Sonne of God, but howe shall he knowe that?
There is but thre wa[y]s of knowing himselfe to be the Sonne of God: 1.
<i>Scientia unionis</i>, and soe Christ onely knowes himselfe to be the Sonne of
God. 2. <i>Scientia visionis</i>, and soe the Saints. 3. <i>Scientia revelationis</i>, and
soe every Christian. And this last is twofold, either by a descendant course,
whereby Gods spirit comes downe to us, and this those knowe which have
it. Philosophie sayth every lambe knowes his owne dame, <i>non per eundem
sonum sed per eundem Spiritum</i>: as the uniting of the Father and
the Sonne in the Trinity is <i>per communionem Spiritus</i>. "My sheepe heare
my voyce," by inward perception. "Did not our harts glowe within us?"
The difference is knowne to them that have it. Samuel, before he was
acquainted with it, thought it had bin the voyce of a man, but Ely could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
discerne it. 2. Wee knowe by our Spirit ascending to God: the Spirit
like fyre, still ascendeth, like a steele toucht with the magnet turnes northward,
<span class="sidenote">fo. 125.</span>soe this heavenward. Wee are placed twixt heaven and earth;
like an iron betwixt two loadstones wee incline still to one of them.</p>

<p>I nominate my kinsman and son-in-love, John Manningham, gentleman,

will, that he perform and pay all and every legacy in this my last will
given within six months at the farthest after my death, those excepted
that are appointed to be paid at certain days limited, and those also to be
duly paid at their days appointed and limited, all according to my true
intent and meaning, as my trust is in him, and as he will answer afore
God and me at the latter day.</p>

<p>If it be needful, I confirm to my executor the grant and gift formerly
by me unto him made of all this my mansion house called Bradborne
with my lands situate in East Malling, except as in the same gift is
excepted, in which said grant I have reserved to myself a power to dispose
of the premises, by will or otherwise, to what persons I list for the space

Malling, and to his heirs for ever, except one tenement lately purchased of
John Goldsmyth, now in the occupation of Harry Metcalfe, and that other
tenement in Melstreet [Mill street?] called Hackstables, lately purchased
of John Dowle, both which tenements I give to my bailiff Thomas Rayner
and to his heirs for ever; and also excepting to my poor servant Thomas

in Hadlow or elsewhere in Kent, lately purchased of Thomas Tutsom, now
in the occupation of John Bredger, to be equally divided between them,
and I give to each of them 20 nobles in money.</p>

<p>Having thus, I thank God, finished this my last will and testament, and
set an order in my worldy affairs, I will now henceforward await God's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
merciful will and pleasure, to depart hence in peace when his blessed will
shall be to call for me, most humbly beseeching him of his infinite
goodness and mercy that when the final day of my dissolution shall be
come I may by his grace be armed with a true and lively faith, firm hope,
and constant patience against all the assaults and temptations of my
ghostly enemy the Devil, and to be willing and ready to forsake all to go
to my blessed Saviour and Redeemer Jesus Christ. Amen, good Lord.</p>

<p class="hang"><a href="#Page_x" style="font-style:italic;">Introd. p. x.</a>&mdash;Although born in Hampshire, there is reason to believe, from
a similarity of arms, that Thomas Manningham, Bishop of Chichester,
was descended from the Cambridgeshire branch of our Diarist's family.
He was educated at Winchester and New College, Oxford. His principal
preferments in the church were the Preachership at the Rolls, the
Lectureship at the Temple, and the Rectory of St. Andrew's Holborn,
to which last he was presented by the Crown in 1691; he also held a
royal chaplaincy, and the Deanery of Windsor, to which he was appointed
in 1708. He kept his Deanery in <i>commendam</i> with his Bishopric.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Many
of his sermons were published; one preached at St. Andrew's on the
death of Queen Mary, 4to. London, 1695, passed through at any event
three editions, and has an interest from the preacher's delineation
of the amiable character of his royal mistress.</p>

<p class="addenda">Sir Richard Manningham published, besides certain more strictly
professional works, "An Exact Diary" (another Manningham's Diary)
"of what was observ'd during a close attendance upon Mary Toft, the
pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey, from Monday Nov.
28 to Wednesday Dec. 7 following. Together with an account of her
confession of the Fraud. By Sir Richard Manningham, Kt. Fellow of
the Royal Society, and of the College of Physicians, London." (Lond.
8vo. 1726.) Another of Sir Richard's good deeds was the erection of
the well-known Park Chapel, Chelsea.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> He died on the 11th May

should have had a note to point out that the combination of these
two names leads one to suppose that the Davis alluded to was probably
the future Sir John Davies, and that the Martin to whom this saucy
witticism is attributed, may have been the Richard Martin commemorated
by Ben Jonson, and the person for a scandalous attack upon whom
Davies was temporarily struck off the books of the Middle Temple,
as mentioned at <a href="#Page_168">p. 168</a>. The outrage occurred on the 9th February
1597-8. Davies was restored to his membership of the Inn on the 30th
October 1601. The late Lord Stowell, in his communication to the
Society of Antiquaries on this subject (Archæologia, xxi. 108,) somewhat
favours a suggestion of Alexander Chalmers that a rivalry between
Martin and Davies in colloquial wit may have led to Davies's misconduct.
The peculiarity in Sir John's gait noticed at <a href="#Page_168">p. 168</a>, and which
would attract more attention among young students than it deserved,
was probably not unique. Sir Walter Scott, who no doubt drew from an
original, describes something very like it in the instance of Baillie
Macwheeble, who waddled across the court-yard of the manor-house of
Tully Veolan, like a turnspit walking upon its hind legs.</p>

him in other terms:&mdash;"He alone was a well-furnished library, full of
all faculties, of all studies, of all learning; the memory and reading of
that man were near to a miracle." The opinion of all his most distinguished
contemporaries agreed with that of Bishop Hall. (Wood's

Goris Besselles, merchant-strangers, 400<i>l.</i> which remained due with all interest upon it
up to the 21st January 1611-12, the date of his will. He forgave his debtors the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">15</span></a> We referred the passage to our late dear friend the eminent Kentish antiquary and
founder of the Archæological Society for that county, the Rev. Lambert B. Larking, and
received in reply one of his customary kindly and suggestive letters. Since we wrote to
him, his earthly career has come, alas! to an end. The Camden Council have lost a
distinguished member, and many persons a singularly warm-hearted and unselfish friend.
He was indeed one of those attractive characters who carry into old age the fervour and
generosity of early life. There never lived a man in whose heart of hearts there dwelt a
deeper scorn of everything untruthful, disingenuous, or mean, or who was more distinguished
by a total abandonment of all selfish interests. Deeply versed in the history of
his beloved native county, and possessed of large antiquarian collections derived principally
from unpublished materials, the information which he had gathered through a course
of many years was at the service of every applicant, and frequently furnished valuable
materials for other writers, whilst an over-anxiety to attain an impossible completeness
prevented his bringing to an end works which would have established his own right to a
high position in the literature of research. His work on the Domesday of Kent we trust
will soon be issued to the subscribers. We doubt not that it will justify our estimate of
the scholarship and diligence in inquiry of our kind and amiable friend.</p></div>

of being concerned in half the plots and duels of his day. He was in trouble with
the Earl of Essex, and again about the Powder Plot, and probably knew familiarly all the
prisons in the metropolis. He died about six years after the time with which our Diarist
is dealing, at Newhall, in Essex, the seat of his friend the Earl of Sussex. The Earl
attended his funeral, and laid him honourably in the chapel of the Ratcliffes. See <i>Liber

two centuries after the time of our Diarist. It was written in the style of the Mirror for
Magistrates, and was clearly intended for insertion in some subsequent edition of that
popular work, but there were obvious reasons connected with its subject-matter which
would operate against its publication in the reign of Elizabeth and in that of her successor,
and after that time the Mirror had fallen out of fashion, another style of poetry
had come into vogue, Queen Mary and her sorrows had lost for a time their hold upon the
public mind, and the Tragicall History was consequently entirely lost sight of. In 1810
it was found by Mr. John Fry in a manuscript belonging to a gentleman named Fryer, and
was published by Mr. Fry in a volume entitled "The Legend of Mary Queen of Scots and
other ancient Poems, now first published from MSS. of the 16th century." (Lond. 8vo.)
At the end of the principal poem there occurs in Mr. Fryer's MS. the date of the 10th
July 1601, with the name of the supposed and, in all probability, the real author, Thomas
Wenman. He is thought to be the person of those names who contributed one of the
commendatory poems prefixed to the second part of Browne's Britannia's Pastorals, published
in 1616. Wenman was of the Inner Temple. He was Public Orator of the University
of Oxford from 1594 to 1597 (Wood's Athenæ, ii. 365. Fasti, i. 251. Hardy's Le Neve,
iii. 534,) and, as may be gathered from Mr. Fryer's MS., was a Roman Catholic. We
doubted whether the extracts given by our Diarist should be printed, the whole poem
having been included in the volume edited by Mr. Fry, but after consideration we have
come to the conclusion that it was best to do so: 1, Because Mr. Fry's impression was an
extremely small one, and the poem is consequently very little known, even to poetical
antiquaries; and 2, Because many of the lines here quoted supply other readings, and in
many cases correct obvious misreadings, in the edition of Mr. Fry. The tenour of the
writer's opinions upon the moot points of Queen Mary's history may be gathered
even from our Diarist's disjointed extracts. The numbers added in the margin within
brackets refer to the stanzas of the poem as printed by Mr. Fry.</p></div>

same name existed in London much about this time, under the captainship of Sir
Edmund Baynham, a well-known young roysterer. On the death of Queen Elizabeth,
Sir Edmund was committed to prison by the Council for declaring openly that the King
of Scotland was a schismatic, and that he would not acknowledge him as King. In
1605 the same gentleman was sent to Rome by the Gunpowder Conspirators that he might
be there, as their agent, to communicate with the Pope, after the plot should have taken
effect. Garnet helped him on his way to Rome by a letter to the Pope's Nuncio in Flanders.

"He took horse," apparently at the lodging of the Knight Marshal at Charing Cross
(probably at the old Mews), "between nine and ten o'clock," on the morning of Thursday
the 24th of March, "and that night rode to Doncaster," about 160 miles. On Friday
night he came to his own house at Widdrington, about another 135 miles. "Very early
on Saturday he was again on horseback and reached Norham on the Tweed about <a name="tn_png_180"></a><!--TN: Quote added after "noon."-->noon."
This was about 50 more miles, and left only about another 50 miles, "so that," he
says, "I might well have been with the King at supper time: but I got a great fall by
the way, and my horse, with one of his heels, gave me a great blow on the head, that
made me shed much blood. It made me so weak that I was forced to ride a soft pace
after, so that the King was newly gone to bed by the time that I knocked at the gate" [of
Holyrood House.] (Memoirs of Robert Cary, Earl of Monmouth, ed. Edinb. 1808. pp.

Robert Cary will be observed by every one who turns to his Memoirs before referred to.
The principal fact in this entry is that James was foolish enough to reward the bringer
of good tidings with an appointment as gentleman of his bed-chamber. The thing was so
silly, and so much in the nature of an affront to the English Council, that the over-delighted
monarch was obliged to withdraw the appointment, much to Cary's annoyance.

longing desire in all his majesties subiects to enioy the sight of his royall person and
presence" which had induced "very many of good degree and quality to hasten and take
their iourneys unto his highnesse," was that the country whither such "over-much resort
and concourse" was made, being "over-charged with multitude, scarcity and dearth was
like ynough to proceed." (Book of Procs. fol. 1609, p. 5.) His Majesty left Edinburgh
on the 5th April, the day on which this proclamation was published at Whitehall, and
entered Berwick the day following.</p></div>
